What Operating Systems Do
     We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system's role in the
     overall computer system. A computer system can be divided roughly into four
     components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs,
     and the users (Figure 1.1).
          The hardware--the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the
     input/output (I/O) devices--provides the basic computing resources for the
     system. The application programs--such as word processors, spreadsheets,
     compilers, and Web browsers--define the ways in which these resources are
     used to solve users' computing problems. The operating system controls the
     hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for
     the various users.
          We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software,
     and data. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these
     resources in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is
     similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by
     itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do
     useful work.
          To understand more fully the operating system's role, we next explore
     operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system.
     1.1.1  User View
     The    user 's  view   of  the  computer  varies       according         to  the  interface  being
     used. Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor,
     keyboard, mouse, and system unit. Such a system is designed for one user
