An Integrated Deadlock Strategy

     As Table 6.1 suggests, there are strengths and weaknesses to all of the strategies for
     dealing with deadlock. Rather than attempting to design an OS facility that employs
     only one of these strategies, it might be more efficient to use different strategies in
     different situations. [HOWA73] suggests one approach:
       Group resources into a number of different resource classes.
       Use the linear ordering strategy defined previously for the prevention of circular
        wait to prevent deadlocks between resource classes.
       Within a resource class, use the algorithm that is most appropriate for that class.
        As an example of this technique, consider the following classes of resources:
       Swappable space: Blocks of memory on secondary storage for use in swapping
        processes
       Process resources: Assignable devices, such as tape drives, and files
       Main memory: Assignable to processes in pages or segments
       Internal resources: Such as I/O channels
        The order of the preceding list represents the order in which resources are
     assigned. The order is a reasonable one, considering the sequence of steps that a
     process may follow during its lifetime. Within each class, the following strategies
     could be used:
       Swappable space: Prevention of deadlocks by requiring that all of the required
        resources that may be used be allocated at one time, as in the hold-and-wait
        prevention strategy. This strategy is reasonable if the maximum storage
        requirements are known, which is often the case. Deadlock avoidance is also a
        possibility.
       Process resources: Avoidance will often be effective in this category, because
        it is reasonable to expect processes to declare ahead of time the resources that
        they will require in this class. Prevention by means of resource ordering within
        this class is also possible.
       Main memory: Prevention by preemption appears to be the most appropriate
        strategy for main memory. When a process is preempted, it is simply swapped
        to secondary memory, freeing space to resolve the deadlock.
       Internal resources: Prevention by means of resource ordering can be used.
