Readers/Writers Problem

     In dealing with the design of synchronization and concurrency mechanisms, it is
     useful to be able to relate the problem at hand to known problems and to be able
     to test any solution in terms of its ability to solve these known problems. In the
     literature, several problems have assumed importance and appear frequently, both
     because they are examples of common design problems and because of their edu-
     cational value. One such problem is the producer/consumer problem, which has
     already been explored. In this section, we look at another classic problem: the read-
     ers/writers problem.
         The readers/writers problem is defined as follows: There is a data area shared
     among a number of processes. The data area could be a file, a block of main mem-
     ory, or even a bank of processor registers. There are a number of processes that
     only read the data area (readers) and a number that only write to the data area
     (writers). The conditions that must be satisfied are as follows:
     1.  Any number of readers may simultaneously read the file.
     2.  Only one writer at a time may write to the file.
     3.  If a writer is writing to the file, no reader may read it.
         Thus, readers are processes that are not required to exclude one another and
     writers are processes that are required to exclude all other processes, readers and
     writers alike.
         Before proceeding, let us distinguish this problem from two others: the general
     mutual exclusion problem and the producer/consumer problem. In the readers/writ-
     ers problem readers do not also write to the data area, nor do writers read the data
     area while writing. A more general case, which includes this case, is to allow any of
     the processes to read or write the data area. In that case, we can declare any por-
     tion of a process that accesses the data area to be a critical section and impose the
     general mutual exclusion solution. The reason for being concerned with the more
     restricted case is that more efficient solutions are possible for this case and that the
     less efficient solutions to the general problem are unacceptably slow. For example,
     suppose that the shared area is a library catalog. Ordinary users of the library read
     the catalog to locate a book. One or more librarians are able to update the catalog.
     In the general solution, every access to the catalog would be treated as a critical sec-
     tion, and users would be forced to read the catalog one at a time. This would clearly
     impose intolerable delays. At the same time, it is important to prevent writers from

     interfering with each other and it is also required to prevent reading while writing is
     in progress to prevent the access of inconsistent information.
           Can the producer/consumer problem be considered simply a special case of
     the readers/writers problem with a single writer (the producer) and a single reader
     (the consumer)? The answer is no. The producer is not just a writer. It must read
     queue pointers to determine where to write the next item, and it must determine if
     the buffer is full. Similarly, the consumer is not just a reader, because it must adjust
     the queue pointers to show that it has removed a unit from the buffer.
           We now examine two solutions to the problem.
     Readers Have Priority
     Figure 5.22 is a solution using semaphores, showing one instance each of a reader
     and a writer; the solution does not change for multiple readers and writers. The
     writer process is simple. The semaphore wsem is used to enforce mutual exclusion.
     As long as one writer is accessing the shared data area, no other writers and no
     readers may access it. The reader process also makes use of wsem to enforce mutual
     exclusion. However, to allow multiple readers, we require that, when there are no
     readers reading, the first reader that attempts to read should wait on wsem. When
     /*   program     readersandwriters      */
     int   readcount;
     semaphore     x   =  1,wsem     =   1;
     void     reader()
     {
           while   (true){
              semWait     (x);
              readcount++;
              if(readcount       ==  1)
                  semWait       (wsem);
              semSignal      (x);
              READUNIT();
              semWait     (x);
              readcount;
              if(readcount       ==  0)
                  semSignal        (wsem);
              semSignal      (x);
           }
     }
     void     writer()
     {
           while   (true){
              semWait     (wsem);
              WRITEUNIT();
              semSignal      (wsem);
           }
     }
     void     main()
     {
           readcount      =  0;
           parbegin       (reader,writer);
     }

                      Priority

there is already at least one reader reading, subsequent readers need not wait before
entering. The global variable readcount is used to keep track of the number of
readers, and the semaphore x is used to assure that readcount is updated properly.
Writers Have Priority
In the previous solution, readers have priority. Once a single reader has begun to
access the data area, it is possible for readers to retain control of the data area as
long as there is at least one reader in the act of reading. Therefore, writers are sub-
ject to starvation.
      Figure 5.23 shows a solution that guarantees that no new readers are allowed
access to the data area once at least one writer has declared a desire to write. For

           writers, the following semaphores and variables are added to the ones already
           defined:
           ·  A semaphore rsem that inhibits all readers while there is at                 least one writer
              desiring access to the data area
           ·  A variable writecount that controls the setting of rsem
           ·  A semaphore y that controls the updating of writecount
              For readers, one additional semaphore is needed. A long queue must not
           be allowed to build up on rsem; otherwise writers will not be able to jump the
           queue. Therefore, only one reader is allowed to queue on rsem, with any additional
           readers queueing on semaphore z, immediately before waiting on rsem. Table 5.6
           summarizes the possibilities.
              An alternative solution, which gives writers priority and which is implemented
           using message passing, is shown in Figure 5.24. In this case, there is a controller
           process that has access to the shared data area. Other processes wishing to access
           the data area send a request message to the controller, are granted access with an
           "OK" reply message, and indicate completion of access with a "finished" message.
           The controller is equipped with three mailboxes, one for each type of message that
           it may receive.
              The controller process services write request messages before read request
           messages to give writers priority. In addition, mutual exclusion must be enforced.
           To do this the variable count is used, which is initialized to some number greater
           than the maximum possible number of readers. In this example, we use a value of
           100. The action of the controller can be summarized as follows:
           ·  If count > 0, then no writer is waiting and there may or may not be read-
              ers active. Service all "finished" messages first to clear active readers. Then
              service write requests and then read requests.
           ·  If count = 0, then the only request outstanding is a write request. Allow the
              writer to proceed and wait for a "finished" message.

               ·  If count < 0, then a writer has made a request and is being made to wait
                  to clear all active readers. Therefore, only "finished" messages should be
                  serviced.
