   If there is one singular characteristic that makes squirrels unique
   among    small   mammals   it  is  their  natural  instinct  to    hoard  food.
   Squirrels have developed sophisticated capabilities in their hoarding.
   Different types of food are stored in different ways to maintain quality.
   Mushrooms, for instance, are usually dried before storing. This is done
   by impaling them on branches or leaving them in the forks of trees for
   later retrieval. Pine cones, on the other hand, are often harvested while
   green and cached in damp conditions that keep seeds from ripening.
   Gray squirrels usually strip outer husks from walnuts before storing.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
  Describe the basic concepts of files and file systems.
  Understand the principal techniques for file organization and access.
  Define B-trees.
  Explain file directories.
  Understand the requirements for file sharing.
  Understand the concept of record blocking.
  Describe the principal design issues for secondary storage management.
  Understand the design issues for file system security.
  Explain the OS file systems used in Linux, UNIX, and Windows 7.
In most applications, the file is the central element. With the exception of real-time
applications and some other specialized applications, the input to the application is
by means of a file; and in virtually all applications, output is saved in a file for long-
term storage and for later access by the user and by other programs.
   Files have a life outside of any individual application that uses them for input
and/or output. Users wish to be able to access files, save them, and maintain the
integrity of their contents. To aid in these objectives, virtually all operating systems
provide file management systems. Typically, a file management system consists of
system utility programs that run as privileged applications. However, at the very
least, a file management system needs special services from the operating system;
at the most, the entire file management system is considered part of the operating
system. Thus, it is appropriate to consider the basic elements of file management in
this book.
   We begin with an overview, followed by a look at various file organization
schemes. Although file organization is generally beyond the scope of the operating
system, it is essential to have a general understanding of the common alternatives to
appreciate some of the design trade-offs involved in file management. The remain-
der of this chapter looks at other topics in file management.
