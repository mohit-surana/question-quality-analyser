          Redirect the system call table: The attacker redirects references to the entire
           system call table to a new table in a new kernel memory location.
14.6    RECOMMENDED READING AND WEB SITES
        The topics in this chapter are covered in more detail in [STAL08]. It is useful to
        read some of the classic tutorial papers on computer security; these provide a his-
        torical perspective from which to appreciate current work and thinking. The papers
        to read are [WARE79], [BROW72], [SALT75], [SHAN77], and [SUMM84]. Two
        more recent short treatments of computer security are [ANDR04] and [LAMP04].
        [NIST95] is an exhaustive (290 pages) treatment of the subject. Another good treat-
        ment is [NRC91]. Also useful is [FRAS97].

        Problems
        14.1     Consider an automated teller machine (ATM) in which users provide a personal iden-
                 tification number (PIN) and a card for account access. Give examples of confidenti-
                 ality, integrity, and availability requirements associated with the system and, in each
                 case, indicate the degree of importance of the requirement.
        14.2     Repeat the preceding problem for a telephone switching system that routes calls
                 through a switching network based on the telephone number requested by the caller.
        14.3     Consider a desktop     publishing  system    used    to  produce     documents  for  various
                 organizations.
                 a.  Give an example of a type of publication for which confidentiality of the stored
                     data is the most important requirement.
                 b.  Give an example of a type of publication in which data integrity is the most impor-
                     tant requirement.
                 c.  Give an example in which system availability is the most important requirement.
