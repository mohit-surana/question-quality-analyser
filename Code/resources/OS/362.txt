           LEARNING OBJECTIVES
           After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
              Define virtual memory.
              Describe the hardware and control structures that support virtual memory.
              Describe the various OS mechanisms used to implement virtual memory.
              Describe the virtual memory management mechanisms in UNIX, Linux, and
               Windows 7.
           Chapter 7 introduced the concepts of paging and segmentation and analyzed their
           shortcomings. We now move to a discussion of virtual memory. An analysis of this
           topic is complicated by the fact that memory management is a complex interrela-
           tionship between processor hardware and operating system software. We focus first
           on the hardware aspect of virtual memory, looking at the use of paging, segmenta-
           tion, and combined paging and segmentation. Then we look at the issues involved in
           the design of a virtual memory facility in operating systems.
                 Table 8.1 defines some key terms related to virtual memory. A set of anima-
           tions that illustrate concepts in this chapter is available online. Click on the rotating
