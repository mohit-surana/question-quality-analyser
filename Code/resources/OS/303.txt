UNIX Concurrency Mechanisms

      UNIX provides a variety of mechanisms for interprocessor communication and syn-
      chronization. Here, we look at the most important of these:
             ·  Pipes
             ·  Messages
             ·  Shared memory
             ·  Semaphores
             ·  Signals

Pipes, messages, and shared memory can be used to communicate data between
processes, whereas semaphores and signals are used to trigger actions by other
processes.
Pipes
One of the most significant contributions of UNIX to the development of operating
systems is the pipe. Inspired by the concept of coroutines [RITC84], a pipe is a circu-
lar buffer allowing two processes to communicate on the producer­consumer model.
Thus, it is a first-in-first-out queue, written by one process and read by another.
When a pipe is created, it is given a fixed size in bytes. When a process attempts
to write into the pipe, the write request is immediately executed if there is sufficient
room; otherwise the process is blocked. Similarly, a reading process is blocked if
it attempts to read more bytes than are currently in the pipe; otherwise the read
request is immediately executed. The OS enforces mutual exclusion: that is, only
one process can access a pipe at a time.
There are two types of pipes: named and unnamed. Only related processes
can share unnamed pipes, while either related or unrelated processes can share
named pipes.
Messages
A message is a block of bytes with an accompanying type. UNIX provides msgsnd
and msgrcv system calls for processes to engage in message passing. Associated
with each process is a message queue, which functions like a mailbox.
The message sender specifies the type of message with each message sent, and
this can be used as a selection criterion by the receiver. The receiver can either
retrieve messages in first-in-first-out order or by type. A process will block when
trying to send a message to a full queue. A process will also block when trying to
read from an empty queue. If a process attempts to read a message of a certain type
and fails because no message of that type is present, the process is not blocked.
Shared Memory
The fastest form of interprocess communication provided in UNIX is shared
memory. This is a common block of virtual memory shared by multiple processes.
Processes read and write shared memory using the same machine instructions they
use to read and write other portions of their virtual memory space. Permission is
read-only or read-write for a process, determined on a per-process basis. Mutual
exclusion constraints are not part of the shared-memory facility but must be provided
by the processes using the shared memory.
Semaphores
The semaphore system calls in UNIX System V are a generalization of the semWait
and semSignal primitives defined in Chapter 5; several operations can be per-
formed simultaneously and the increment and decrement operations can be values
greater than 1. The kernel does all of the requested operations atomically; no other
process may access the semaphore until all operations have completed.

        A semaphore consists of the following elements:
     ·  Current value of the semaphore
     ·  Process ID of the last process to operate on the semaphore
     ·  Number of processes waiting for the semaphore value to be greater          than its
        current value
     ·  Number of processes waiting for the semaphore value to be zero
     Associated with the semaphore are queues of processes blocked on that semaphore.
        Semaphores are actually created in sets, with a semaphore set consisting of
     one or more semaphores. There is a semctl system call that allows all of the sema-
     phore values in the set to be set at the same time. In addition, there is a sem_op
     system call that takes as an argument a list of semaphore operations, each defined
     on one of the semaphores in a set. When this call is made, the kernel performs the
     indicated operations one at a time. For each operation, the actual function is speci-
     fied by the value sem_op. The following are the possibilities:
     ·  If sem_op is positive, the kernel increments the value of the semaphore and
        awakens all processes waiting for the value of the semaphore to increase.
     ·  If sem_op is 0, the kernel checks the semaphore value. If the semaphore value
        equals 0, the kernel continues with the other operations on the list. Otherwise,
        the kernel increments the number of processes waiting for this semaphore to be
        0 and suspends the process to wait for the event that the value of the semaphore
        equals 0.
     ·  If sem_op is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to the sema-
        phore value, the kernel adds sem_op (a negative number) to the semaphore
        value. If the result is 0, the kernel awakens all processes waiting for the value
        of the semaphore to equal 0.
     ·  If sem_op is negative and its absolute value is greater than the semaphore
        value, the kernel suspends the process on the event that the value of the sema-
        phore increases.
        This generalization of the semaphore provides considerable flexibility in per-
     forming process synchronization and coordination.
     Signals
     A signal is a software mechanism that informs a process of the occurrence of asyn-
     chronous events. A signal is similar to a hardware interrupt but does not employ
     priorities. That is, all signals are treated equally; signals that occur at the same time
     are presented to a process one at a time, with no particular ordering.
        Processes may send each other signals, or the kernel may send signals inter-
     nally. A signal is delivered by updating a field in the process table for the process
     to which the signal is being sent. Because each signal is maintained as a single bit,
     signals of a given type cannot be queued. A signal is processed just after a process
     wakes up to run or whenever the process is preparing to return from a system call.
     A process may respond to a signal by performing some default action (e.g., termina-
     tion), executing a signal-handler function, or ignoring the signal.
        Table 6.2 lists signals defined for UNIX SVR4.
