B-Trees

      The preceding section referred to the use of an index file to access individual records
      in a file or database. For a large file or database, a single sequential file of indexes on
      the primary key does not provide for rapid access. To provide more efficient access,
      a structured index file is typically used. The simplest such structure is a two-level
      organization in which the original file is broken into sections and the upper level
      consists of a sequenced set of pointers to the lower-level sections. This structure can
      then be extended to more than two levels, resulting in a tree structure. Unless some
      discipline is imposed on the construction of the tree index, it is likely to end up with
      an uneven structure, with some short branches and some long branches, so that the
      time to search the index is uneven. Therefore, a balanced tree structure, with all
      branches of equal length, would appear to give the best average performance. Such a
      structure is the B-tree, which has become the standard method of organizing indexes
      for databases and is commonly used in OS file systems, including those supported by
      Mac OS X, Windows, and several Linux file systems. The B-tree structure provides
      for efficient searching, adding, and deleting of items.

       Before illustrating the concept of B-tree, let us define a B-tree and its char-
acteristics more precisely. A B-tree is a tree structure (no closed loops) with the
following characteristics (Figure 12.4).
1.     The tree consists of a number of nodes and leaves.
2.     Each node contains at least one key which uniquely identifies a file record,
       and more than one pointer to child nodes or leaves. The number of keys and
       pointers contained in a node may vary, within limits explained below.
3.     Each node is limited to the same number of maximum keys.
4.     The keys in a node are stored in nondecreasing order. Each key has an
       associated child that is the root of a subtree containing all nodes with keys
       less than or equal to the key but greater than the preceding key. A node also
       has an additional rightmost child that is the root for a subtree containing
       all keys greater than any keys in the node. Thus, each node has one more
       pointer than keys.
       A B-tree is characterized by its minimum degree d and satisfies the following
properties:
1.     Every node has at most 2d ­ 1 keys and 2d children or, equivalently, 2d pointers.2
2.     Every node, except for the root, has at least d ­ 1 keys and d pointers. As a
       result, each internal node, except the root, is at least half full and has at least d
       children.
3.     The root has at least 1 key and 2 children.
4.     All leaves appear on the same level and contain no information. This is a
       logical construct to terminate the tree; the actual implementation may differ.
       For example, each bottom-level node may contain keys alternating with null
       pointers.
5.     A nonleaf node with k pointers contains k ­ 1 keys.
       Typically, a B-tree has a relatively large branching factor (large number of
children) resulting in a tree of low height.
       Figure 12.4 illustrates two levels of a B-tree. The upper level has (k ­ 1) keys
and k pointers and satisfies the following relationship:
                                 Key1 6 Key3 6            c  6  Keyk - 1
2Some  treatments  require,  as  stated  here,  that  the  maximum  number  of  keys  in  a   node  is  odd
(e.g., [CORM09]); others specify even [COME79]; still others allow odd or even [KNUT98]. The choice
does not fundamentally affect the performance of B-trees.

         Each pointer points to a node that is the top level of a subtree of this upper-
     level node. Each of these subtree nodes contains some number of keys and pointers,
     unless it is a leaf node. The following relationships hold:
     All the keys in Subtree1                                     are less than Key1
     All the keys in Subtree2         are greater than Key1       and are less than Key2
     All the keys in Subtree3         are greater than Key2       and are less than Key3
         ·                                     ·                               ·
         ·                                     ·                               ·
         ·                                     ·                               ·
     All the keys in Subtreek­1       are greater than Keyk­2     and are less than Keyk­1
     All the keys in Subtreek         are greater than Keyk­1
         To search for a key, you start at the root node. If the key you want is in the
     node, you're done. If not, you go down one level. There are three cases:
     1.  The key you want is less then the smallest key in this node. Take the leftmost
         pointer down to the next level.
     2.  The key you want is greater than the largest key in this node. Take the right-
         most pointer down to the next level.
     3.  The value of the key is between the values of two adjacent keys in this node.
         Take the pointer between these keys down to the next level.
         For example, consider the tree in Figure 12.5d and the desired key is 84. At the
     root level, 84  51, so you take the rightmost branch down to the next level. Here, we
     have 61  84  71, so you take the pointer between 61 and 71 down to the next level,
     where the key 84 is found. Associated with this key is a pointer to the desired record.
     An advantage of this tree structure over other tree structures is that it is broad and
     shallow, so that the search terminates quickly. Furthermore, because it is balanced
     (all branches from root to leaf are of equal length), there are no long searches com-
     pared to other searches.
         The rules for inserting a new key into the B-tree must maintain a balanced
     tree. This is done as follows:
     1.  Search the tree for the key. If the key is not in the tree, then you have reached
         a node at the lowest level.
     2.  If this node has fewer than 2d ­ 1 keys, then insert the key into this node in the
         proper sequence.
     3.  If the node is full (having 2d ­ 1 keys), then split this node around its median
         key into two new nodes with d ­ 1 keys each and promote the median key to
         the next higher level, as described in step 4. If the new key has a value less
         than the median key, insert it into the left­hand new node; otherwise insert
         it into the right­hand new node. The result is that the original node has been
         split into two nodes, one with d ­ 1 keys and one with d keys.
     4.  The promoted node is inserted into the parent node following the rules of step
         3. Therefore, if the parent node is already full, it must be split and its median
         key promoted to the next highest layer.
     5.  If the process of promotion reaches the root node and the root node is already
         full, then insertion again follows the rules of step 3. However, in this case the
         median key becomes a new root node and the height of the tree increases by 1.

                           (b) Key = 90 inserted. This is a simple insertion into a node.

      (c) Key = 45 inserted. This requires splitting a node into two parts and promoting one key to the root node.

      (d) Key = 84 inserted. This requires splitting a node into two parts and promoting one key to the root node.
                       This then requires the root node to be split and a new root created.
