   Operating systems are those programs that interface the machine with
   the applications programs. The main function of these systems is to
   dynamically allocate the shared system resources to the executing
   programs. As such, research in this area is clearly concerned with
   the management and scheduling of memory, processes, and other
   devices. But the interface with adjacent levels continues to shift with
   time. Functions that were originally part of the operating system have
   migrated to the hardware. On the other side, programmed functions
   extraneous to the problems being solved by the application programs
   are included in the operating system.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
  Summarize, at a top level, the key functions of an operating system (OS).
  Discuss the evolution of operating systems for early simple batch systems to
   modern complex systems.
  Give a brief explanation of each of the major achievements in OS research,
   as defined in Section 2.3.
  Discuss the key design areas that have been instrumental in the development
   of modern operating systems.
  Define and discuss virtual machines and virtualization
  Understand the OS design issues raised by the introduction of multiprocessor
   and multicore organization.
  Understand the basic structure of Windows 7.
  Describe the essential elements of a traditional UNIX system.
  Explain the new features found in modern UNIX systems.
  Discuss Linux and its relationship to UNIX.
We begin our study of operating systems (OSs) with a brief history. This history is
itself interesting and also serves the purpose of providing an overview of OS prin-
ciples. The first section examines the objectives and functions of operating systems.
Then we look at how operating systems have evolved from primitive batch systems
to sophisticated multitasking, multiuser systems. The remainder of the chapter looks
at the history and general characteristics of the two operating systems that serve as
examples throughout this book. All of the material in this chapter is covered in
greater depth later in the book.
