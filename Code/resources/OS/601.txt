eCos
      ·  Provides for special alarms and time-outs
      ·  Supports real-time queuing disciplines such as earliest deadline first and
         primitives for jamming a message into the front of a queue
      ·  Provides primitives to delay processing by a fixed amount of time and to
         suspend/resume execution
         The characteristics just listed are common in embedded operating systems with
      real-time requirements. However, for complex embedded systems, the requirement
      may emphasize predictable operation over fast operation, necessitating different
      design decisions, particularly in the area of task scheduling.
13.3  ECOS
      The Embedded Configurable Operating System (eCos) is an open source, royalty-
      free, real-time OS intended for embedded applications. The system is targeted at
      high-performance small embedded systems. For such systems, an embedded form
      of Linux or other commercial OS would not provide the streamlined software
      required. The eCos software has been implemented on a wide variety of proces-
      sor platforms, including Intel IA32, PowerPC, SPARC, ARM, CalmRISC, MIPS,
      and NEC V8xx. It is one of the most widely used embedded operating systems. It is
      implemented in C/C++.
      Configurability
      An embedded OS that is flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of embed-
      ded applications and on a wide variety of embedded platforms must provide more
      functionality than will be needed for any particular application and platform. For
      example, many real-time operating systems support task switching, concurrency
      controls, and a variety of priority scheduling mechanisms. A relatively simple
      embedded system would not need all these features.
         The challenge is to provide an efficient, user-friendly mechanism for configur-
      ing selected components and for enabling and disabling particular features within
      components. The eCos configuration tool, which runs on Windows or Linux, is used
      to configure an eCos package to run on a target embedded system. The complete
      eCos package is structured hierarchically, making it easy, using the configuration
      tool, to assemble a target configuration. At a top level, eCos consists of a number of
      components, and the configuration user may select only those components needed
      for the target application. For example, a system might have a particular serial I/O
      device. The configuration user would select serial I/O for this configuration, then
      select one or more specific I/O devices to be supported. The configuration tool
      would include the minimum necessary software for that support. The configuration
      user can also select specific parameters, such as default data rate and the size of I/O
      buffers to be used.
         This configuration process can be extended down to finer levels of detail, even
      to the level of individual lines of code. For example, the configuration tool provides
      the option of including or omitting a priority inheritance protocol.

             Figure 13.2 shows the top level of the eCos configuration tool as seen by
     the tool user. Each of the items on the list in the left-hand window can be
     selected or deselected. When an item is highlighted, the lower right-hand window
     provides a description and the upper right-hand window provides a link to further
     documentation plus additional information about the highlighted item. Items on
     the list can be expanded to provide a finer-grained menu of options. Figure 13.3
     illustrates an expansion of the eCos kernel option. In this figure, note that excep-
     tion handling has been selected for inclusion, but SMP (symmetric multiprocessing)
     has been omitted. In general, components and individual options can be selected
     or omitted. In some cases, individual values can be set; for example, a minimum
     acceptable stack size is an integer value that can be set or left to a default value.
             Figure 13.4 shows a typical example of the overall process of creating the
     binary image to execute in the embedded system. This process is run on a source
     system, such as a Windows or Linux platform, and the executable image is des-
     tined to execute on a target embedded system, such as a sensor in an industrial
     environment. At the highest software level is the application source code for the
     particular embedded application. This code is independent of eCos but makes use
     of application programming interfaces (API) to sit on top of the eCos software.
     There may be only one version of the application source code, or there may be
     variations for different versions of the target embedded platform. In this example,
     the GNU make utility is used to selectively determine which pieces of a program

     need to be compiled or recompiled (in the case of a modified version of the source
     code) and issues the commands to recompile them. The GNU cross compiler,
     executing on the source platform, then generates the binary executable code for
     the target embedded platform. The GNU linker links the application object code
     with the code generated by the eCos configuration tool. This latter set of software
     includes selected portions of the eCos kernel plus selected software for the target
     embedded system. The result can then be loaded into the target system.
     eCos Components
     A key design requirement for eCos is portability to different architectures and plat-
     forms with minimal effort. To meet this requirement, eCos consists of a layered set
     of components (Figure 13.5).
     HARDWARE ABSTRACTION LAYER    At the bottom is the hardware abstraction layer
     (HAL). The HAL is software that presents a consistent API to the upper layers and
     maps upper-layer operations onto a specific hardware platform. Thus, the HAL is
     different for each hardware platform. Figure 13.6 is an example that demonstrates
     how the HAL abstracts hardware-specific implementations for the same API call
     on two different platforms. As this example shows, the call from an upper layer to
     enable interrupts is the same on both platforms, but the C code implementation of
     the function is specific to each platform.
        The HAL is implemented as three separate modules:
     ·  Architecture: Defines the processor family type. This module contains the code
        necessary for processor startup, interrupt delivery, context switching, and other
        functionality specific to the instruction set architecture of that processor family.
     ·  Variant: Supports the features of the specific processor in the family. An
        example of a supported feature is an on-chip module such as a memory man-
        agement unit (MMU).
     ·  Platform: Extends the HAL support to tightly coupled peripherals like
        interrupt controllers and timer devices. This module defines the platform
        or board that includes the selected processor architecture and variant. It
        includes code for startup, chip selection configuration, interrupt controllers,
        and timer devices.

ECOS KERNEL     The eCos kernel was designed to satisfy four main objectives:
·   Low interrupt latency: The time it takes to respond to an interrupt and begin
    executing an ISR.
·   Low task switching latency: The time it takes from when a thread becomes
    available to when actual execution begins.
·   Small memory footprint: Memory resources for both program and data are
    kept to a minimum by allowing all components to configure memory as needed.
·   Deterministic behavior: Throughout all aspect of execution, the kernels
    performance must be predictable and bounded to meet real-time application
    requirements.
    The eCos kernel provides the core functionality needed for developing multi-
threaded applications:
1.  The ability to create new threads in the system, either during startup or when
    the system is already running
2.  Control over the various threads in the system: for example, manipulating
    their priorities
3.  A choice of schedulers, determining which thread should currently be running

     4.  A range of synchronization primitives, allowing threads to interact and share
         data safely
     5.  Integration with the system's support for interrupts and exceptions
         Some functionality that is typically included in the kernel of an OS is not
     included in the eCos kernel. For example, memory allocation is handled by a sepa-
     rate package. Similarly, each device driver is a separate package. Various packages
     are combined and configured using the eCos configuration technology to meet the
     requirements of the application. This makes for a lean kernel. Further, the minimal
     nature of the kernel means that for some embedded platforms, the eCos kernel is
     not used at all. Simple single-threaded applications can be run directly on HAL.
     Such configurations can incorporate needed C library functions and device drivers
     but avoid the space and time overhead of the kernel.
         There are two different techniques for utilizing kernel functions in eCos. One
     way to employ kernel functionality is by using the C API of kernel. Examples of
     such functions are cyg_thread_create and cyg_mutex_lock. These functions can be
     invoked directly from application code. On the other hand, kernel functions can
     also be invoked by using compatibility packages for existing API's, for example
     POSIX threads or ITRON. The compatibility packages allow application code to
     call standard functions like pthread_create, and those functions are implemented
     using the basic functions provided by the eCos kernel. Code sharing and reusability
     of already developed code is easily achieved by use of compatibility packages.
     I/O SYSTEM  The eCos I/O system is a framework for supporting device drivers. A
     variety of drivers for a variety of platforms are provided in the eCos configuration
     package. These include drivers for serial devices, Ethernet, flash memory interfaces,
     and various I/O interconnects such as PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
     and USB (Universal Serial Bus). In addition, users can develop their own device
     drivers.
         The principal objective for the I/O system is efficiency, with no unnecessary
     software layering or extraneous functionality. Device drivers provide the necessary
     functions for input, output, buffering, and device control.
         As mentioned, device drivers and other higher-layer software may be imple-
     mented directly on the HAL if this is appropriate. If specialized kernel-type functions
     are needed, then the device driver is implemented using kernel APIs. The kernel
     provides a three-level interrupt model [ECOS07]:
     ·   Interrupt service routines (ISRs): Invoked in response to a hardware interrupt.
         Hardware interrupts are delivered with minimal intervention to an ISR. The
         HAL decodes the hardware source of the interrupt and calls the ISR of the
         attached interrupt object. This ISR may manipulate the hardware but is only
         allowed to make a restricted set of calls on the driver API. When it returns, an
         ISR may request that its DSR should be scheduled to run.
     ·   Deferred service routines (DSRs): Invoked in response to a request by an ISR.
         A DSR will be run when it is safe to do so without interfering with the sched-
         uler. Most of the time the DSR will run immediately after the ISR, but if the
         current thread is in the scheduler, it will be delayed until the thread is finished.

                A DSR is allowed to make a larger set of driver API calls, including, in particu-
                lar, being able to call cyg_drv_cond_signal() to wake up waiting threads.
             ·  Threads: The clients of the driver. Threads are able to make all API calls and
                in particular are allowed to wait on mutexes and condition variables.
                Tables 13.2 and 13.3 show the device driver interface to the kernel. These
tables give a good feel for the type of functionality available in the kernel to support
Table 13.2   Device Driver Interface to the eCos Kernel: Concurrency
cyg_drv_spinlock_init       Initialize a spinlock in a locked or unlocked state.
cyg_drv_spinlock_destroy    Destroy a spinlock that is no longer of use.
cyg_drv_spinlock_spin       Claim a spinlock, waiting in a busy loop until it is available.
cyg_drv_spinlock_clear      Clear a spinlock. This clears the spinlock and allows another CPU to claim it.
If there is more than one CPU waiting in cyg_drv_spinlock_spin, then just one of them will be allowed
to proceed.
cyg_drv_spinlock_test       Inspect the state of the spinlock. If the spinlock is not locked, then the result is
TRUE. If it is locked, then the result will be FALSE.
cyg_drv_spinlock_spin_intsave            This function behaves like cyg_drv_spinlock_spin except
that it also disables interrupts before attempting to claim the lock. The current interrupt enable state is saved
in *istate. Interrupts remain disabled once the spinlock has been claimed and must be restored by calling
cyg_drv_spinlock_clear_intsave. Device drivers should use this function to claim and release
spinlocks rather than the non-_intsave() variants, to ensure proper exclusion with code running on both other
CPUs and this CPU.
cyg_drv_mutex_init          Initialize a mutex.
cyg_drv_mutex_destroy       Destroy a mutex. The mutex should be unlocked and there should be no
threads waiting to lock it when this call in made.
cyg_drv_mutex_lock          Attempt to lock the mutex pointed to by the mutex argument. If the mutex is
already locked by another thread, then this thread will wait until that thread is finished. If the result from this
function is FALSE, then the thread was broken out of its wait by some other thread. In this case, the mutex will
not have been locked.
cyg_drv_mutex_trylock       Attempt to lock the mutex pointed to by the mutex argument without waiting.
If the mutex is already locked by some other thread then this function returns FALSE. If the function can
lock the mutex without waiting, then TRUE is returned.
cyg_drv_mutex_unlock        Unlock the mutex pointed to by the mutex argument. If there are any threads
waiting to claim the lock, one of them is woken up to try and claim it.
cyg_drv_mutex_release       Release all threads waiting on the mutex.
cyg_drv_cond_init           Initialize a condition variable associated with a mutex with. A thread may only
wait on this condition variable when it has already locked the associated mutex. Waiting will cause the mutex
to be unlocked, and when the thread is reawakened, it will automatically claim the mutex before continuing.
cyg_drv_cond_destroy        Destroy the condition variable.
cyg_drv_cond_wait           Wait for a signal on a condition variable.
cyg_drv_cond_signal         Signal a condition variable. If there are any threads waiting on this variable, at
least one of them will all be awakened.
cyg_drv_cond_broadcast      Signal a condition variable. If there are any threads waiting on this variable,
they will all be awakened.

Table 13.3     Device Driver Interface to the eCos Kernel: Interrupts
cyg_drv_isr_lock           Disable delivery of interrupts, preventing all ISRs running. This function maintains a
counter of the number of times it is called.
cyg_drv_isr_unlock          Reenable delivery of interrupts, allowing ISRs to run. This function decrements
the counter maintained by cyg_drv_isr_lock, and only reallows interrupts when it goes to zero.
cyg_ISR_t      Define ISR.
cyg_drv_dsr_lock           Disable scheduling of DSRs. This function maintains a counter of the number of
times it has been called.
cyg_drv_dsr_unlock          Reenable scheduling of DSRs. This function decrements the counter incremented
by cyg_drv_dsr_lock.        DSRs are only allowed to be delivered when the counter goes to zero.
cyg_DSR_t      Define DSR prototype.
cyg_drv_interrupt_create        Create an interrupt object and returns a handle to it.
cyg_drv_interrupt_delete        Detach the interrupt from the vector and free the memory for reuse.
cyg_drv_interrupt_attach        Attach an interrupt to a vector so that interrupts will be delivered to the
ISR when the interrupt occurs.
cyg_drv_interrupt_detach        Detach the interrupt from the vector so that interrupts will no longer be
delivered to the ISR.
cyg_drv_interrupt_mask          Program the interrupt controller to stop delivery of interrupts on the
given vector.
cyg_drv_interrupt_mask_intunsafe                  Program the interrupt controller to stop delivery of interrupts
on the given vector. This version differs from cyg_drv_interrupt_mask in not being interrupt safe. So
in situations where, for example, interrupts are already known to be disabled, this may be called to avoid the
extra overhead.
cyg_drv_interrupt_unmask,       cyg_drv_interrupt_unmask_intunsafe                      Program the interrupt
controller to reallow delivery of interrupts on the given vector.
cyg_drv_interrupt_acknowledge                 Perform any processing required at the interrupt controller and in
the CPU to cancel the current interrupt request.
cyg_drv_interrupt_configure           Program the interrupt controller with the characteristics of the
interrupt source.
cyg_drv_interrupt_level         Program the interrupt controller to deliver the given interrupt at the
supplied priority level.
cyg_drv_interrupt_set_cpu       On multiprocessor systems, this function causes all interrupts on the
given vector to be routed to the specified CPU. Subsequently, all such interrupts will be handled by that CPU.
cyg_drv_interrupt_get_cpu       On multiprocessor systems, this function returns the ID of the CPU to
which interrupts on the given vector are currently being delivered.
     device drivers. Note that the device driver interface can be configured for one or
     more of the following concurrency mechanisms: spinlocks, condition variables, and
     mutexes. These are described in a subsequent portion of this discussion.
     STANDARD C LIBRARIES                     A complete Standard C run-time library is provided. Also
     included is a complete math run time library for high-level mathematics functions,
     including a complete IEEE-754 floating-point library for those platforms without
     hardware floating points.

eCos Scheduler
The eCos kernel can be configured to provide one of two scheduler designs: the
bitmap scheduler and a multilevel queue scheduler. The configuration user selects
the appropriate scheduler for the environment and the application. The bitmap
scheduler provides efficient scheduling for a system with a small number of threads
that may be active at any point in time. The multiqueue scheduler is appropriate
if the number of threads is dynamic or if it is desirable to have multiple threads
at the same priority level. The multilevel scheduler is also needed if time slicing
is desired.
BITMAP SCHEDULER        A bitmap scheduler supports multiple priority levels, but only
one thread can exist at each priority level at any given time. Scheduling decisions
are quite simple with this scheduler (Figure 13.7a). When a blocked thread becomes
ready to run, it may preempt a thread of lower priority. When a running thread
suspends, the ready thread with the highest priority is dispatched. A thread can
be suspended because it is blocked on a synchronization primitive, because it is
interrupted, or because it relinquishes control. Because there is only one thread,
at most, at each priority level, the scheduler does not have to make a decision as to
which thread at a given priority level should be dispatched next.
The bitmap scheduler is configured with 8, 16, or 32 priority levels. A simple
bitmap is kept of the threads that are ready to execute. The scheduler need only
determine the position of the most significant one bit in the bitmap to make a sched-
uling decision.
MULTILEVEL       QUEUE  SCHEDULER  As with the bitmap scheduler, the multilevel
queue scheduler supports up to 32 priority levels. The multilevel queue scheduler
allows for multiple active threads at each priority level, limited only by system
resources.
Figure 13.7b illustrates the nature of the multilevel queue scheduler. A data
structure represents the number of ready threads at each priority level. When a
blocked thread becomes ready to run, it may preempt a thread of lower priority.
As with the bitmap scheduler, a running thread may be blocked on a synchroniza-
tion primitive, because it is interrupted, or because it relinquishes control. When
a thread is blocked, the scheduler must first determine if one or more threads at
the same priority level as the blocked thread is ready. If so, the scheduler chooses
the one at the front of the queue. Otherwise, the scheduler looks for the next
highest priority level with one or more ready threads and dispatches one of these
threads.
In addition, the multilevel queue scheduler can be configured for time slicing.
Thus, if a thread is running and there is one or more ready threads at the same
priority level, the scheduler will suspend the running thread after one time slice
and choose the next thread in the queue at that priority level. This is a round-robin
policy within one priority level. Not all applications require time slicing. For exam-
ple, an application may contain only threads that block regularly for some other
reason. For these applications, the user can disable time slicing, which reduces the
overhead associated with timer interrupts.

eCos Thread Synchronization
The eCos kernel can be configured to include one or more of six different thread
synchronization mechanisms. These include the classic synchronization mecha-
nisms: mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables. In addition, eCos supports
two synchronization/communication mechanisms that are common in real-time
systems, namely event flags and mailboxes. Finally, the eCos kernel supports spin-
locks, which are useful in SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) systems.
MUTEXES  The mutex (mutual exclusion lock) was introduced in Chapter 6. Recall
that a mutex is used to enforce mutually exclusive access to a resource, allowing
only one thread at a time to gain access. The mutex has only two states: locked and
unlocked. This is similar to a binary semaphore: When a mutex is locked by one
thread, any other thread attempting to lock the mutex is blocked; when the mutex is
unlocked, then one of the threads blocked on this mutex is unblocked and allowed
to lock the mutex and gain access to the resource.
The mutex differs from a binary semaphore in two respects. First, the thread
that locks the mutex must be the one to unlock it. In contrast, it is possible for
one thread to lock a binary semaphore and for another to unlock it. The other
difference is that a mutex provides protection against priority inversion, whereas a
semaphore does not.
The eCos kernel can be configured to support either a priority inheritance
protocol or a priority ceiling protocol. These are described in Chapter 10.
SEMAPHORES      The eCos kernel provides support for a counting semaphore. Recall
from Chapter 5 that a counting semaphore is an integer value used for signaling
among threads. The cyg_semaphore_init is used to initialize a semaphore. The
cyg_semaphore_post command increments the semaphore count when an event
occurs. If the new count is less than or equal to zero, then a thread is waiting on
this semaphore and is awakened. The cyg_semaphore_wait function checks the
value of a semaphore count. If the count is zero, the thread calling this function will
wait for the semaphore. If the count is nonzero, the count is decremented and the
thread continues.
Counting semaphores are suited to enabling threads to wait until an event
has occurred. The event may be generated by a producer thread, or by a DSR in
response to a hardware interrupt. Associated with each semaphore is an integer
counter that keeps track of the number of events that have not yet been processed.
If this counter is zero, an attempt by a consumer thread to wait on the semaphore
will block until some other thread or a DSR posts a new event to the semaphore.
If the counter is greater than zero, then an attempt to wait on the semaphore will
consume one event, in other words decrement the counter, and return immedi-
ately. Posting to a semaphore will wake up the first thread that is currently waiting,
which will then resume inside the semaphore wait operation and decrement the
counter again.
Another use of semaphores is for certain forms of resource management. The
counter would correspond to how many of a certain type of resource are currently
available, with threads waiting on the semaphore to claim a resource and posting to

     release the resource again. In practice, condition variables are usually much better
     suited for operations like this.
     CONDITION  VARIABLES  A condition variable is used to block a thread until a
     particular condition is true. Condition variables are used with mutexes to allow
     multiple threads to access shared data. They can be used to implement monitors
     of the type discussed in Chapter 6 (e.g., Figure 6.14). The basic commands are as
     follows:
     cyg_cond_wait                     Causes the current threat to wait on the specified con-
                                       dition variable and simultaneously unlocks the mutex
                                       attached to the condition variable
     cyg_cond_signal                   Wakes up one of the threads waiting on this condition
                                       variable, causing that thread to become the owner of
                                       the mutex
     cyg_cond_broadcast                Wakes up all the threads waiting on this condition
                                       variable. Each thread that was waiting on the condi-
                                       tion variable becomes the owner of the mutex when
                                       it runs.
     In eCos, condition variables are typically used in conjunction with mutexes to
     implement long-term waits for some condition to become true. We use an example
     from [ECOS07] to illustrate. Figure 13.8 defines a set of functions to control access
     to a pool of resources using mutexes. The mutex is used to make the allocation
     and freeing of resources from a pool atomic. The function res_t       res_allocate
     checks to see if one or more units of a resource are available and, if so, takes one
     unit. This operation is protected by a mutex so that no other thread can check or
     alter the resource pool while this thread has control of the mutex. The function
     res_free(res_t  res) enables a thread to release one unit of a resource that it
     had previously acquired. Again, this operation is made atomic by a mutex.
     In this example, if a thread attempts to access a resource and none are
     available, the function returns RES_NONE. Suppose, however, that we want the
     thread to be blocked and wait for a resource to become available, rather than
     returning RES_NONE. Figure 13.9 accomplishes this with the use of a condition
     variable associated with the mutex. When res_allocate detects that there are
     no resources, it calls cyg_cond_wait. This latter function unlocks the mutex
     and puts the calling thread to sleep on the condition variable. When res_free
     is eventually called, it puts a resource back into the pool and calls cyg_cond_
     signal to wake up any thread waiting on the condition variable. When the wait-
     ing thread eventually gets to run again, it will relock the mutex before returning
     from cyg_cond_wait.
     [ECOS07] points out two significant features of this example, and of the use
     of condition variables in general. First, the mutex unlock and wait in cyg_cond_
     wait are atomic: No other thread can run between the unlock and the wait. If this
     were not the case, then a call to res_free by some other thread would release
     the resource, but the call to cyg_cond_signal would be lost, and the first thread
     would end up waiting when there were resources available.

}
Figure 13.8    Controlling Access to a Pool  of  Resources  Using  Mutexes
                  The second feature is that the call to cyg_cond_wait is in a while loop
          and not a simple if statement. This is because of the need to relock the mutex in
          cyg_cond_wait when the signaled thread reawakens. If there are other threads
          already queued to claim the lock, then this thread must wait. Depending on the
          scheduler and the queue order, many other threads may have entered the critical
          section before this one gets to run. So the condition that it was waiting for may have
          been rendered false. Using a loop around all condition variable wait operations is the
          only way to guarantee that the condition being waited for is still true after waiting.
          EVENT FLAGS          An event flag is a 32-bit word used as a synchronization mechanism.
          Application code may associate a different event with each bit in a flag. A thread
          can wait for either a single event or a combination of events by checking one or
          multiple bits in the corresponding flag. The thread is blocked until all of the required
          bits are set (AND) or until at least one of the bits is set (OR). A signaling thread
          can set or reset bits based on specific conditions or events so that the appropriate

       thread is unblocked. For example, bit 0 could represent completion of a specific I/O
       operation, making data available, and bit 1 could indicate that the user has pressed
       a start button. A producer thread or DSR could set these two bits, and a consumer
       thread waiting on these two events will be woken up.
                 A thread can wait on one or more events using the cyg_flag_wait com-
       mand, which takes three arguments: a particular event flag, a combination of bit
       positions in the flag, and a mode parameter. The mode parameter specifies whether
       the thread will block until all the bits are set (AND) or until at least one of the bits
       is set (OR). The mode parameter may also specify that when the wait succeeds, the
       entire event flag is cleared (set to all zeros).
       MAILBOXES            Mailboxes, also called message boxes, are an eCos synchronization
       mechanism that provides a means for two threads to exchange information.

Section 5.5 provides a general discussion of message-passing synchronization.
Here, we look at the specifics of the eCos version.
The eCos mailbox mechanism can be configured for blocking or nonblocking
on both the send and receive side. The maximum size of the message queue associ-
ated with a given mailbox can also be configured.
The send message primitive, called put, includes two arguments: a handle to
the mailbox and a pointer for the message itself. There are three variants to this
primitive:
cyg_mbox_put                If there is a spare slot in the mailbox, then the new message is
                            placed there; if there is a waiting thread, it will be woken up
                            so that it can receive the message. If the mailbox is currently
                            full, cyg_mbox_put blocks until there has been a corre-
                            sponding get operation and a slot ids available.
cyg_mbox_timed_put          Same as cyg_mbox_put if there is a spare slot. Otherwise,
                            the function will wait a specified time limit and place the
                            message if a slot becomes available. If the time limit expires,
                            the operation returns false. Thus, cyg_mbox_timed_
                            put is blocking only for less than or equal to a specified
                            time interval.
cyg_mbox_tryput             This is a nonblocking version, which returns true if the
                            message is sent successfully and false if the mailbox is full.
Similarly, there are three  variants to the get primitive.
cyg_mbox_get                If there is a pending message in the specified mailbox,
                            cyg_mbox_get returns with the message that was put into
                            the mailbox. Otherwise this function blocks until there is a
                            put operation.
cyg_mbox_timed_get          Immediately returns a message if one is available. Otherwise,
                            the function will wait until either a message is available or
                            until a number of clock ticks have occurred. If the time limit
                            expires, the operation returns a null pointer. Thus, cyg_box_
                            timed_get is blocking only for less than or equal
                            to a specified time interval.
cyg_mbox_tryget             This is a nonblocking version, which returns a message if one
                            is available and a null pointer if the mailbox is empty.
SPINLOCKS   A spinlock is a flag that a thread can check before executing a particular
piece of code. Recall from our discussion of Linux spinlocks in Chapter 6 the basic
operation of the spinlock: Only one thread at a time can acquire a spinlock. Any
other thread attempting to acquire the same lock will keep trying (spinning) until it
can acquire the lock. In essence, a spinlock is built on an integer location in memory
that is checked by each thread before it enters its critical section. If the value is 0,
the thread sets the value to 1 and enters its critical section. If the value is nonzero,
the thread continually checks the value until it is zero.
A spinlock should not be used on a single-processor system, which is why it
is compiled away on Linux. As an example of the danger, consider a uniprocessor

      system with preemptive scheduling, in which a higher-priority thread attempts to
      acquire a spinlock already held by a lower priority thread. The lower-priority thread
      cannot execute so as to finish its work and release the spinlock, because the higher-
      priority thread preempts it. The higher-priority thread can execute but is stuck
      checking the spinlock. As a result, the higher-priority thread will just loop forever
      and the lower-priority thread will never get another chance to run and release the
      spinlock. On an SMP system, the current owner of a spinlock can continue running
      on a different processor.
13.4  TINYOS
      The eCos system provides a more streamlined approach for an embedded OS than
      one based on a commercial general-purpose OS, such as an embedded version of
      Linux. Thus, eCos and similar systems are better suited for small embedded systems
      with tight requirements on memory, processing time, real-time response, power
      consumption, and so on. TinyOS takes the process of streamlining to a much further
      point, resulting in a very minimal OS for embedded systems. The core OS requires
      400 bytes of code and data memory, combined.
      TinyOS represents a significant departure from other embedded operating
      systems. One striking difference is that TinyOS is not a real-time OS. The reason for
      this is the expected workload, which is in the context of a wireless sensor network,
      as described in the next subsection. Because of power consumption, these devices
      are off most of the time. Applications tend to be simple, with processor contention
      not much of an issue.
      Additionally, in TinyOS there is no kernel, as there is no memory protection
      and it is a component-based OS; there are no processes; the OS itself does not have
      a memory allocation system (although some rarely used components do introduce
      one); interrupt and exception handling is dependent on the peripheral; and it is
      completely nonblocking, so there are few explicit synchronization primitives.
      TinyOS has become a popular approach to implementing wireless sensor
      network software. Currently, over 500 organizations are developing and contributing
      to an open source standard for Tiny OS.
      Wireless Sensor Networks
      TinyOS was developed primarily for use with networks of small wireless sensors. A
      number of trends have enabled the development of extremely compact, low-power
      sensors. The well-known Moore's law continues to drive down the size of memory
      and processing logic elements. Smaller size in turn reduces power consumption. Low
      power and small size trends are also evident in wireless communications hardware,
      micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS), and transducers. As a result, it is possible
      to develop an entire sensor complete with logic in a cubic millimeter. The application
      and system software must be compact enough that sensing, communication, and com-
      putation capabilities can be incorporated into a complete, but tiny, architecture.
      Low­cost, small­size, low-power-consuming wireless sensors can be used in a
      host of applications [ROME04]. Figure 13.10 shows a typical configuration. A base
