6.8        LINUX KERNEL CONCURRENCY MECHANISMS
           Linux includes all of the concurrency mechanisms found in other UNIX systems,
           such as SVR4, including pipes, messages, shared memory, and signals. In addi-
           tion, Linux 2.6 includes a rich set of concurrency mechanisms specifically intended
           for use when a thread is executing in kernel mode. That is, these are mechanisms
           used within the kernel to provide concurrency in the execution of kernel code. This
           section examines the Linux kernel concurrency mechanisms.
           Atomic Operations
           Linux provides a set of operations that guarantee atomic operations on a variable.
           These operations can be used to avoid simple race conditions. An atomic operation
           executes without interruption and without interference. On a uniprocessor system,
           a thread performing an atomic operation cannot be interrupted once the operation
           has started until the operation is finished. In addition, on a multiprocessor system,

           the variable being operated on is locked from access by other threads until this oper-
           ation is completed.
              Two types of atomic operations are defined in Linux: integer operations,
           which operate on an integer variable, and bitmap operations, which operate
           on one bit in a bitmap (Table 6.3). These operations must be implemented on
           any architecture that implements Linux. For some architectures, there are cor-
           responding assembly language instructions for the atomic operations. On other
           architectures, an operation that locks the memory bus is used to guarantee that
           the operation is atomic.
              For atomic integer operations, a special data type is used, atomic_t. The
           atomic integer operations can be used only on this data type, and no other operations

are allowed on this data type. [LOVE04] lists the following advantages for these
restrictions:
1.  The atomic operations are never used on variables that might in some circum-
    stances be unprotected from race conditions.
2.  Variables of this data type are protected from improper use by nonatomic
    operations.
3.  The compiler cannot erroneously optimize access to the value (e.g., by using
    an alias rather than the correct memory address).
4.  This data type serves to hide architecture-specific differences in its imple-
    mentation.
    A typical use of the atomic integer data type is to implement counters.
    The atomic bitmap operations operate on one of a sequence of bits at an arbi-
trary memory location indicated by a pointer variable. Thus, there is no equivalent
to the atomic_t data type needed for atomic integer operations.
    Atomic operations are the simplest of the approaches to kernel synchroniza-
tion. More complex locking mechanisms can be built on top of them.
Spinlocks
The most common technique used for protecting a critical section in Linux is the spin-
lock. Only one thread at a time can acquire a spinlock. Any other thread attempting
to acquire the same lock will keep trying (spinning) until it can acquire the lock. In
essence a spinlock is built on an integer location in memory that is checked by each
thread before it enters its critical section. If the value is 0, the thread sets the value to
1 and enters its critical section. If the value is nonzero, the thread continually checks
the value until it is zero. The spinlock is easy to implement but has the disadvantage
that locked-out threads continue to execute in a busy-waiting mode. Thus spinlocks
are most effective in situations where the wait time for acquiring a lock is expected
to be very short, say on the order of less than two context changes.
    The basic form of use of a spinlock is the following:
    spin_lock(&lock)
    /*  critical         section  */
    spin_unlock(&lock)
BASIC SPINLOCKS  The basic spinlock (as opposed to the reader­writer spinlock
explained subsequently) comes in four flavors (Table 6.4):
·   Plain: If the critical section of code is not executed by interrupt handlers or if
    the interrupts are disabled during the execution of the critical section, then the
    plain spinlock can be used. It does not affect the interrupt state on the processor
    on which it is run.
·   _irq: If interrupts are always enabled, then this spinlock should be used.
·   _irqsave: If it is not known if interrupts will be enabled or disabled at the time
    of execution, then this version should be used. When a lock is acquired, the cur-
    rent state of interrupts on the local processor is saved, to be restored when the
    lock is released.

Table 6.4  Linux Spinlocks
void  spin_lock(spinlock_t     *lock)               Acquires the specified lock, spinning if needed
                                                    until it is available
void  spin_lock_irq(spinlock_t         *lock)       Like spin_lock, but also disables interrupts on the
                                                    local processor
void  spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t          *lock,  Like spin_lock_irq, but also saves the current
unsigned   long  flags)                             interrupt state in flags
void  spin_lock_bh(spinlock_t          *lock)       Like spin_lock, but also disables the execution
                                                    of all bottom halves
void  spin_unlock(spinlock_t        *lock)          Releases given lock
void  spin_unlock_irq(spinlock_t       *lock)       Releases given lock and enables local interrupts
void  spin_unlock_irqrestore(spinlock_t             Releases given lock and restores local interrupts
*lock,     unsigned  long   flags)                  to given previous state
void  spin_unlock_bh(spinlock_t        *lock)       Releases given lock and enables bottom halves
void  spin_lock_init(spinlock_t        *lock)       Initializes given spinlock
int   spin_trylock(spinlock_t       *lock)          Tries to acquire specified lock; returns nonzero if
                                                    lock is currently held and zero otherwise
int   spin_is_locked(spinlock_t        *lock)       Returns nonzero if lock is currently held and zero
                                                    otherwise
           ·  _bh: When an interrupt occurs, the minimum amount of work necessary is
              performed by the corresponding interrupt handler. A piece of code, called
              the bottom half, performs the remainder of the interrupt-related work, allow-
              ing the current interrupt to be enabled as soon as possible. The _bh spinlock
              is used to disable and then enable bottom halves to avoid conflict with the
              protected critical section.
              The plain spinlock is used if the programmer knows that the protected data
           is not accessed by an interrupt handler or bottom half. Otherwise, the appropriate
           nonplain spinlock is used.
              Spinlocks are implemented differently on a uniprocessor system versus a mul-
           tiprocessor system. For a uniprocessor system, the following considerations apply.
           If kernel preemption is turned off, so that a thread executing in kernel mode cannot
           be interrupted, then the locks are deleted at compile time; they are not needed.
           If kernel preemption is enabled, which does permit interrupts, then the spinlocks
           again compile away (i.e., no test of a spinlock memory location occurs) but are sim-
           ply implemented as code that enables/disables interrupts. On a multiple processor
           system, the spinlock is compiled into code that does in fact test the spinlock loca-
           tion. The use of the spinlock mechanism in a program allows it to be independent
           of whether it is executed on a uniprocessor or multiprocessor system.
           READER­WRITER    SPINLOCK           The reader­writer spinlock is a mechanism that
           allows a greater degree of concurrency within the kernel than the basic spinlock.
           The reader­writer spinlock allows multiple threads to have simultaneous access
           to the same data structure for reading only but gives exclusive access to the

spinlock for a thread that intends to update the data structure. Each reader­writer
spinlock consists of a 24-bit reader counter and an unlock flag, with the following
interpretation:
    Counter      Flag        Interpretation
        0        1           The spinlock is released and available for use
        0        0           Spinlock has been acquired for writing by one thread
    n (n > 0)    0           Spinlock has been acquired for reading by n threads
    n (n > 0)    1           Not valid
    As with the basic spinlock, there are plain, _irq, and _irqsave versions of
the reader­writer spinlock.
    Note that the reader­writer spinlock favors readers over writers. If the spin-
lock is held for readers, then so long as there is at least one reader, the spinlock
cannot be preempted by a writer. Furthermore, new readers may be added to the
spinlock even while a writer is waiting.
Semaphores
At the user level, Linux provides a semaphore interface corresponding to that in
UNIX SVR4. Internally, Linux provides an implementation of semaphores for its
own use. That is, code that is part of the kernel can invoke kernel semaphores.
These kernel semaphores cannot be accessed directly by the user program via sys-
tem calls. They are implemented as functions within the kernel and are thus more
efficient than user-visible semaphores.
    Linux provides three types of semaphore facilities in the kernel: binary sema-
phores, counting semaphores, and reader­writer semaphores.
BINARY  AND      COUNTING    SEMAPHORES   The binary and counting semaphores
defined in Linux 2.6 (Table 6.5) have the same functionality as described for
such semaphores in Chapter 5. The function names down and up are used for the
functions referred to in Chapter 5 as semWait and semSignal, respectively.
    A counting semaphore is initialized using the sema_init function, which gives
the semaphore a name and assigns an initial value to the semaphore. Binary sema-
phores, called MUTEXes in Linux, are initialized using the init_MUTEX and init_
MUTEX_LOCKED functions, which initialize the semaphore to 1 or 0, respectively.
    Linux provides three versions of the down (semWait) operation.
1.  The down function corresponds to the traditional semWait operation. That
    is, the thread tests the semaphore and blocks if the semaphore is not available.
    The thread will awaken when a corresponding up operation on this sema-
    phore occurs. Note that this function name is used for an operation on either a
    counting semaphore or a binary semaphore.
2.  The down_interruptible function allows the thread to receive and
    respond to a kernel signal while being blocked on the down operation. If the
    thread is woken up by a signal, the down_interruptible function incre-
    ments the count value of the semaphore and returns an error code known in

                  Linux as -EINTR. This alerts the thread that the invoked semaphore function
                  has aborted. In effect, the thread has been forced to "give up" the semaphore.
                  This feature is useful for device drivers and other services in which it is conve-
                  nient to override a semaphore operation.
           3.     The down_trylock function makes it possible to try to acquire a semaphore
                  without being blocked. If the semaphore is available, it is acquired. Otherwise,
                  this function returns a nonzero value without blocking the thread.
           READER­WRITER SEMAPHORES            The reader­writer semaphore divides users into
           readers and writers; it allows multiple concurrent readers (with no writers) but only
           a single writer (with no concurrent readers). In effect, the semaphore functions as
           a counting semaphore for readers but a binary semaphore (MUTEX) for writers.
           Table 6.5 shows the basic reader­writer semaphore operations. The reader­writer
           semaphore uses uninterruptible sleep, so there is only one version of each of the
           down operations.

Barriers
In some architectures, compilers and/or the processor hardware may reorder mem-
ory accesses in source code to optimize performance. These reorderings are done
to optimize the use of the instruction pipeline in the processor. The reordering
algorithms contain checks to ensure that data dependencies are not violated. For
example, the code:
       a   =  1;
       b   =  1;
may be reordered so that memory location b is updated before memory location a
is updated. However, the code:
       a   =  1;
       b   =  a;
will not be reordered. Even so, there are occasions when it is important that reads
or writes are executed in the order specified because of use of the information that
is made by another thread or a hardware device.
       To enforce the order in which instructions are executed, Linux provides the
memory barrier facility. Table 6.6 lists the most important functions that are defined
for this facility. The rmb() operation insures that no reads occur across the bar-
rier defined by the place of the rmb() in the code. Similarly, the wmb() operation
insures that no writes occur across the barrier defined by the place of the wmb() in
the code. The mb() operation provides both a load and store barrier.
       Two important points to note about the barrier operations:
1.     The barriers relate to machine instructions, namely loads and stores. Thus the
       higher-level language instruction a  =     b involves both a load (read) from loca-
       tion b and a store (write) to location a.
2.     The rmb, wmb, and mb operations dictate the behavior of both the compiler
       and the processor. In the case of the compiler, the barrier operation dictates
       that the compiler not reorder instructions during the compile process. In the
       case of the processor, the barrier operation dictates that any instructions pend-
       ing in the pipeline before the barrier must be committed for execution before
       any instructions encountered after the barrier.
Table 6.6  Linux Memory Barrier Operations
rmb()               Prevents loads from being reordered across the barrier
wmb()               Prevents stores from being reordered across the barrier
mb()                Prevents loads and stores from being reordered across the barrier
Barrier()           Prevents the compiler from reordering loads or stores across the barrier
smp_rmb()           On SMP, provides a rmb() and on UP provides a barrier()
smp_wmb()           On SMP, provides a wmb() and on UP provides a barrier()
smp_mb()            On SMP, provides a mb() and on UP provides a barrier()
Note: SMP = symmetric multiprocessor;
UP = uniprocessor

        The barrier() operation is a lighter-weight version of the mb() operation,
     in that it only controls the compiler's behavior. This would be useful if it is known
     that the processor will not perform undesirable reorderings. For example, the Intel
     x86 processors do not reorder writes.
        The smp_rmb, smp_wmb, and smp_mb operations provide an optimization for
     code that may be compiled on either a uniprocessor (UP) or a symmetric multiproc-
     essor (SMP). These instructions are defined as the usual memory barriers for an
     SMP, but for a UP, they are all treated only as compiler barriers. The smp_ opera-
     tions are useful in situations in which the data dependencies of concern will only
     arise in an SMP context.
6.9  SOLARIS THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION PRIMITIVES
     In addition to the concurrency mechanisms of UNIX SVR4, Solaris supports four
     thread synchronization primitives:
     ·  Mutual exclusion (mutex) locks
     ·  Semaphores
     ·  Multiple readers, single writer (readers/writer) locks
     ·  Condition variables
        Solaris implements these primitives within the kernel for kernel threads; they
     are also provided in the threads library for user-level threads. Figure 6.15 shows
     the data structures for these primitives. The initialization functions for the primi-
     tives fill in some of the data members. Once a synchronization object is created,
     there are essentially only two operations that can be performed: enter (acquire
     lock) and release (unlock). There are no mechanisms in the kernel or the threads
     library to enforce mutual exclusion or to prevent deadlock. If a thread attempts to
     access a piece of data or code that is supposed to be protected but does not use the
     appropriate synchronization primitive, then such access occurs. If a thread locks
     an object and then fails to unlock it, no kernel action is taken.
        All of the synchronization primitives require the existence of a hardware
     instruction that allows an object to be tested and set in one atomic operation.
     Mutual Exclusion Lock
     A mutex is used to ensure that only one thread at a time can access the resource
     protected by the mutex. The thread that locks the mutex must be the one that
     unlocks it. A thread attempts to acquire a mutex lock by executing the mutex_
     enter primitive. If mutex_enter cannot set the lock (because it is already set
     by another thread), the blocking action depends on type-specific information
     stored in the mutex object. The default blocking policy is a spinlock: A blocked
     thread polls the status of the lock while executing in a busy waiting loop.
     An interrupt-based blocking mechanism is optional. In this latter case, the
     mutex includes a turnstile          id that identifies a queue of threads sleeping on
     this lock.
