Rootkits

      A rootkit is a set of programs installed on a system to maintain administrator (or
      root) access to that system. Root access provides access to all the functions and
      services of the operating system. The rootkit alters the host's standard functionality
      in a malicious and stealthy way. With root access, an attacker has complete control
      of the system and can add or change programs and files, monitor processes, send
      and receive network traffic, and get backdoor access on demand.
         A rootkit can make many changes to a system to hide its existence, mak-
      ing it difficult for the user to determine that the rootkit is present and to iden-
      tify what changes have been made. In essence, a rootkit hides by subverting the
      mechanisms that monitor and report on the processes, files, and registries on a
      computer.
         Rootkits can be classified based on whether they can survive a reboot and
      execution mode. A rootkit may be
        Persistent: Activates each time the system boots. The rootkit must store code
         in a persistent store, such as the registry or file system, and configure a method
         by which the code executes without user intervention.
        Memory based: Has no persistent code and therefore cannot survive a reboot
        User mode: Intercepts calls to APIs (Application Program Interfaces) and mod-
         ifies returned results. For example, when an application performs a directory
         listing, the return results don't include entries identifying the files associated
         with the rootkit.
        Kernel mode: Can intercept calls to native APIs in kernel mode. The root-
         kit can also hide the presence of a malware process by removing it from the
         kernel's list of active processes.
      Rootkit Installation
      Unlike worms or bots, rootkits do not directly rely on vulnerabilities or exploits
      to get on a computer. One method of rootkit installation is via a Trojan horse pro-
      gram. The user is induced to load the Trojan horse, which then installs the rootkit.

     Another means of rootkit installation is by hacker activity. The following sequence
     is representative of a hacker attack to install a rootkit [GEER06].
     1.      The attacker uses a utility to identify open ports or other vulnerabilities.
     2.      The attacker uses password cracking, malware, or a system vulnerability to
             gain initial access and, eventually, root access.
     3.      The attacker uploads the rootkit to the victim's machine.
     4.      The attacker can add a virus, denial of service, or other type of attack to the
             rootkit's payload.
     5.      The attacker then runs the rootkit's installation script.
     6.      The rootkit replaces binaries, files, commands, or system utilities to hide its
             presence.
     7.      The rootkit listens at a port in the target server, installs sniffers or keyloggers,
             activates a malicious payload, or takes other steps to compromise the victim.
     System-Level Call Attacks
     Programs operating at the user level interact with the kernel through system calls.
     Thus, system calls are a primary target of kernel-level rootkits to achieve conceal-
     ment. As an example of how rootkits operate, we look at the implementation of
     system calls in Linux. In Linux, each system call is assigned a unique syscall number.
     When a user-mode process executes a system call, the process refers to the system
     call by this number. The kernel maintains a system call table with one entry per
     system call routine; each entry contains a pointer to the corresponding routine. The
     syscall number serves as an index into the system call table.
             [LEVI06] lists three techniques that can be used to change system calls:
            Modify the system call table: The attacker modifies selected syscall addresses
             stored in the system call table. This enables the rootkit to direct a system call
             away from the legitimate routine to the rootkit's replacement. Figure 14.6
             shows how the knark rootkit achieves this.
            Modify system call table targets: The attacker overwrites selected legitimate
             system call routines with malicious code. The system call table is not changed.

           system call table to a new table in a new kernel memory location.
