Linux

    History
    Linux started out as a UNIX variant for the IBM PC (Intel 80386) architecture.
    Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student of computer science, wrote the initial version.
    Torvalds posted an early version of Linux on the Internet in 1991. Since then, a
    number of people, collaborating over the Internet, have contributed to the devel-
    opment of Linux, all under the control of Torvalds. Because Linux is free and the
    source code is available, it became an early alternative to other UNIX workstations,
    such as those offered by Sun Microsystems and IBM. Today, Linux is a full-featured
    UNIX system that runs on all of these platforms and more, including Intel Pentium
    and Itanium, and the Motorola/IBM PowerPC.
         Key to the success of Linux has been the availability of free software packages
    under the auspices of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). FSF's goal is stable,
    platform-independent software that is free, high quality, and embraced by the user
    community. FSF's GNU project3 provides tools for software developers, and the
    3GNU is a recursive acronym for GNU's Not Unix. The GNU project is a free software set of packages
    and tools for developing a UNIX-like operating system; it is often used with the Linux kernel.

GNU Public License (GPL) is the FSF seal of approval. Torvalds used GNU tools
in developing his kernel, which he then released under the GPL. Thus, the Linux
distributions that you see today are the product of FSF's GNU project, Torvald's
individual effort, and the efforts of many collaborators all over the world.
   In addition to its use by many individual programmers, Linux has now made
significant penetration into the corporate world. This is not only because of the
free software, but also because of the quality of the Linux kernel. Many talented
programmers have contributed to the current version, resulting in a technically
impressive product. Moreover, Linux is highly modular and easily configured. This
makes it easy to squeeze optimal performance from a variety of hardware platforms.
Plus, with the source code available, vendors can tweak applications and utilities to
meet specific requirements. Throughout this book, we will provide details of Linux
kernel internals based on the most recent version, Linux 2.6.
Modular Structure
Most UNIX kernels are monolithic. Recall from earlier in this chapter that a mono-
lithic kernel is one that includes virtually all of the OS functionality in one large
block of code that runs as a single process with a single address space. All the func-
tional components of the kernel have access to all of its internal data structures
and routines. If changes are made to any portion of a typical monolithic OS, all the
modules and routines must be relinked and reinstalled and the system rebooted
before the changes can take effect. As a result, any modification, such as adding
a new device driver or file system function, is difficult. This problem is especially
acute for Linux, for which development is global and done by a loosely associated
group of independent programmers.
   Although Linux does not use a microkernel approach, it achieves many of
the potential advantages of this approach by means of its particular modular archi-
tecture. Linux is structured as a collection of modules, a number of which can be
automatically loaded and unloaded on demand. These relatively independent blocks
are referred to as loadable modules [GOYE99]. In essence, a module is an object
file whose code can be linked to and unlinked from the kernel at runtime. Typically,
a module implements some specific function, such as a file system, a device driver,
or some other feature of the kernel's upper layer. A module does not execute as its
own process or thread, although it can create kernel threads for various purposes
as necessary. Rather, a module is executed in kernel mode on behalf of the current
process.
   Thus, although Linux may be considered monolithic, its modular structure
overcomes some of the difficulties in developing and evolving the kernel.
   The Linux loadable modules have two important characteristics:
  Dynamic linking: A kernel module can be loaded and linked into the kernel
   while the kernel is already in memory and executing. A module can also be
   unlinked and removed from memory at any time.
  Stackable modules: The modules are arranged in a hierarchy. Individual
   modules serve as libraries when they are referenced by client modules higher
   up in the hierarchy, and as clients when they reference modules further down.

                 Dynamic linking [FRAN97] facilitates configuration and saves kernel memory.
    In Linux, a user program or user can explicitly load and unload kernel modules
    using the insmod and rmmod commands. The kernel itself monitors the need for
    particular functions and can load and unload modules as needed. With stackable
    modules, dependencies between modules can be defined. This has two benefits:
           1.    Code common to a set of similar modules (e.g., drivers for similar hardware)
                 can be moved into a single module, reducing replication.
           2.    The kernel can make sure that needed modules are present, refraining from
                 unloading a module on which other running modules depend, and loading any
                 additional required modules when a new module is loaded.
                 Figure 2.19 is an example that illustrates the structures used by Linux to
    manage modules. The figure shows the list of kernel modules after only two modules
    have been loaded: FAT and VFAT. Each module is defined by two tables, the mod-
    ule table and the symbol table. The module table includes the following elements:
                *next: Pointer to the following module. All modules are organized into a
                 linked list. The list begins with a pseudomodule (not shown in Figure 2.19).
                *name: Pointer to module name
                size: Module size in memory pages
                usecount: Module usage counter. The counter is incremented when an opera-
                 tion involving the module's functions is started and decremented when the
                 operation terminates.

            flags: Module flags
            nsyms: Number of exported symbols
            ndeps: Number of referenced modules
            *syms: Pointer to this module's symbol table.
            *deps: Pointer to list of modules that are referenced by this module.
            *refs: Pointer to list of modules that use this module.
             The symbol table defines those symbols controlled by this module that are
used elsewhere.
             Figure 2.19 shows that the VFAT module was loaded after the FAT module
and that the VFAT module is dependent on the FAT module.
Kernel Components
Figure 2.20, taken from [MOSB02], shows the main components of the Linux kernel
as implemented on an IA-64 architecture (e.g., Intel Itanium). The figure shows
several processes running on top of the kernel. Each box indicates a separate pro-
cess, while each squiggly line with an arrowhead represents a thread of execution.4
The kernel itself consists of an interacting collection of components, with arrows

4In Linux, there is no distinction between the concepts of processes and threads. However, multiple
threads in Linux can be grouped together in such a way that, effectively, you can have a single process
comprising multiple threads. These matters are discussed in Chapter 4.

           indicating the main interactions. The underlying hardware is also depicted as a
           set of components with arrows indicating which kernel components use or control
           which hardware components. All of the kernel components, of course, execute on
           the processor but, for simplicity, these relationships are not shown.
              Briefly, the principal kernel components are the following:
             Signals: The kernel uses signals to call into a process. For example, signals are
              used to notify a process of certain faults, such as division by zero. Table 2.5
              gives a few examples of signals.
             System calls: The system call is the means by which a process requests a specific
              kernel service. There are several hundred system calls, which can be roughly
              grouped into six categories: file system, process, scheduling, interprocess com-
              munication, socket (networking), and miscellaneous. Table 2.6 defines a few
              examples in each category.
             Processes and scheduler: Creates, manages, and schedules processes.
             Virtual memory: Allocates and manages virtual memory for processes.

                          priority and a new process gets to run.
