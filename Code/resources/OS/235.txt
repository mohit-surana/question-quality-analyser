Semaphores

           We now turn to OS and programming language mechanisms that are used to pro-
           vide concurrency. Table 5.3 summarizes mechanisms in common use. We begin, in
           this section, with semaphores. The next two sections discuss monitors and message
           passing. The other mechanisms in Table 5.3 are discussed when treating specific
           OS examples, in Chapters 6 and 13.
Table 5.3  Common   Concurrency Mechanisms
Semaphore           An integer value used for signaling among processes. Only three operations may be
                    performed on a semaphore, all of which are atomic: initialize, decrement, and incre-
                    ment. The decrement operation may result in the blocking of a process, and the incre-
                    ment operation may result in the unblocking of a process. Also known as a counting
                    semaphore or a general semaphore.
Binary Semaphore    A semaphore that takes on only the values 0 and 1.
Mutex               Similar to a binary semaphore. A key difference between the two is that the process that
                    locks the mutex (sets the value to zero) must be the one to unlock it (sets the value to 1).
Condition Variable  A data type that is used to block a process or thread until a particular condition is true.
Monitor             A programming language construct that encapsulates variables, access procedures, and
                    initialization code within an abstract data type. The monitor's variable may only be
                    accessed via its access procedures and only one process may be actively accessing the
                    monitor at any one time. The access procedures are critical sections. A monitor may
                    have a queue of processes that are waiting to access it.
Event Flags         A memory word used as a synchronization mechanism. Application code may associ-
                    ate a different event with each bit in a flag. A thread can wait for either a single event
                    or a combination of events by checking one or multiple bits in the corresponding flag.
                    The thread is blocked until all of the required bits are set (AND) or until at least one
                    of the bits is set (OR).
Mailboxes/Messages  A means for two processes to exchange information and that may be used for
                    synchronization.
Spinlocks           Mutual exclusion mechanism in which a process executes in an infinite loop waiting for
                    the value of a lock variable to indicate availability.

         The first major advance in dealing with the problems of concurrent proc-
     esses came in 1965 with Dijkstra's treatise [DIJK65]. Dijkstra was concerned with
     the design of an OS as a collection of cooperating sequential processes and with
     the development of efficient and reliable mechanisms for supporting cooperation.
     These mechanisms can just as readily be used by user processes if the processor and
     OS make the mechanisms available.
         The fundamental principle is this: Two or more processes can cooperate by
     means of simple signals, such that a process can be forced to stop at a specified place
     until it has received a specific signal. Any complex coordination requirement can
     be satisfied by the appropriate structure of signals. For signaling, special variables
     called semaphores are used. To transmit a signal via semaphore s, a process exe-
     cutes the primitive semSignal(s). To receive a signal via semaphore s, a process
     executes the primitive semWait(s); if the corresponding signal has not yet been
     transmitted, the process is suspended until the transmission takes place.4
         To achieve the desired effect, we can view the semaphore as a variable that
     has an integer value upon which only three operations are defined:
     1.  A semaphore may be initialized to a nonnegative integer value.
     2.  The semWait operation decrements the semaphore value. If the value
         becomes negative, then the process executing the semWait is blocked.
         Otherwise, the process continues execution.
     3.  The semSignal operation increments the semaphore value. If the resulting
         value is less than or equal to zero, then a process blocked by a semWait oper-
         ation, if any, is unblocked.
     Other than these three operations, there is no way to inspect or manipulate
     semaphores.
         We explain these operations as follows. To begin, the semaphore has a zero or
     positive value. If the value is positive, that value equals the number of processes that
     can issue a wait and immediately continue to execute. If the value is zero, either by
     initialization or because a number of processes equal to the initial semaphore value
     have issued a wait, the next process to issue a wait is blocked, and the semaphore
     value goes negative. Each subsequent wait drives the semaphore value further into
     minus territory. The negative value equals the number of processes waiting to be
     unblocked. Each signal unblocks one of the waiting processes when the semaphore
     value is negative.
         [DOWN08] points out three interesting consequences of the semaphore
     definition:
     · In general, there is no way to know before a process decrements a semaphore
         whether it will block or not.
     4In Dijkstra's original paper and in much of the literature, the letter P is used for semWait and the letter
     V for semSignal; these are the initials of the Dutch words for test (proberen) and increment (verhogen).
     In some of the literature, the terms wait and signal are used. This book uses semWait and semSig-
     nal for clarity, and to avoid confusion with similar wait and signal operations in monitors, discussed
     subsequently

struct  semaphore       {
        int     count;
        queueType       queue;
};
void   semWait(semaphore          s)
{
        s.count--;
        if   (s.count      <  0)  {
            /*  place      this   process     in   s.queue  */;
            /*  block      this   process     */;
        }
}
void   semSignal(semaphore            s)
{
        s.count++;
        if   (s.count<=       0)  {
            /*  remove     a  process     P   from   s.queue  */;
            /*  place      process    P   on  ready  list   */;
        }
}
Figure 5.3   A Definition of Semaphore Primitives
    ·  After a process increments a semaphore and another process gets woken
       up, both processes continue running concurrently. There is no way to
       know which process, if either, will continue immediately on a uniprocessor
       system.
    ·  When you signal a semaphore, you don't necessarily know whether another
       process is waiting, so the number of unblocked processes may be zero or one.
       Figure 5.3 suggests a more formal definition of the primitives for sema-
phores. The semWait and semSignal primitives are assumed to be atomic. A
more restricted version, known as the binary semaphore, is defined in Figure 5.4.
A binary semaphore may only take on the values 0 and 1 and can be defined by the
following three operations:
   1.  A binary semaphore may be initialized to 0 or 1.
   2.  The semWaitB operation checks the semaphore value. If the value is zero,
       then the process executing the semWaitB is blocked. If the value is one, then
       the value is changed to zero and the process continues execution.
   3.  The semSignalB operation checks to see if any processes are blocked on
       this semaphore (semaphore value equals 0). If so, then a process blocked by a
       semWaitB operation is unblocked. If no processes are blocked, then the value
       of the semaphore is set to one.
       In principle, it should be easier to implement the binary semaphore, and it
can be shown that it has the same expressive power as the general semaphore (see
Problem 5.16). To contrast the two types of semaphores, the nonbinary semaphore
is often referred to as either a counting semaphore or a general semaphore.
       A concept related to the binary semaphore is the mutex. A key difference
between the two is that the process that locks the mutex (sets the value to zero)

     struct  binary_semaphore     {
             enum  {zero,   one}  value;
             queueType  queue;
     };
     void  semWaitB(binary_semaphore         s)
     {
             if  (s.value   ==  one)
                   s.value  =   zero;
             else  {
                            /*  place     this   process  in   s.queue      */;
                            /*  block     this   process  */;
             }
     }
     void  semSignalB(semaphore       s)
     {
             if  (s.queue   is  empty())
                   s.value  =   one;
             else  {
                            /*  remove    a  process  P   from   s.queue    */;
                            /*  place     process  P  on  ready  list       */;
             }
     }
     Figure 5.4  A Definition of Binary Semaphore Primitives
     must be the one to unlock it (sets the value to 1). In contrast, it is possible for one
     process to lock a binary semaphore and for another to unlock it.5
           For both counting semaphores and binary semaphores, a queue is used to
     hold processes waiting on the semaphore. The question arises of the order in
     which processes are removed from such a queue. The fairest removal policy is
     first-in-first-out (FIFO): The process that has been blocked the longest is released
     from the queue first; a semaphore whose definition includes this policy is called
     a strong semaphore. A semaphore that does not specify the order in which proc-
     esses are removed from the queue is a weak semaphore. Figure 5.5, based on
     one in [DENN84], is an example of the operation of a strong semaphore. Here
     processes A, B, and C depend on a result from process D. Initially (1), A is run-
     ning; B, C, and D are ready; and the semaphore count is 1, indicating that one of
     D's results is available. When A issues a semWait instruction on semaphore s,
     the semaphore decrements to 0, and A can continue to execute; subsequently it
     rejoins the ready queue. Then B runs (2), eventually issues a semWait instruc-
     tion, and is blocked, allowing D to run (3). When D completes a new result, it
     issues a semSignal instruction, which allows B to move to the ready queue (4).
     D rejoins the ready queue and C begins to run (5) but is blocked when it issues a
     semWait instruction. Similarly, A and B run and are blocked on the semaphore,
     allowing D to resume execution (6). When D has a result, it issues a semSignal,
     which transfers C to the ready queue. Later cycles of D will release A and B from
     the Blocked state.
     5In some of the literature, and in some textbooks, no distinction is made between a mutex and a binary
     semaphore. However, in practice, a number of operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and Solaris
     offer a mutex facility which conforms to the definition in this book.

     Figure 5.6     Mutual Exclusion Using Semaphores
            For the mutual exclusion algorithm discussed in the next subsection and illus-
     trated in Figure 5.6, strong semaphores guarantee freedom from starvation, while
     weak semaphores do not. We will assume strong semaphores because they are more
     convenient and because this is the form of semaphore typically provided by operat-
     ing systems.
     Mutual Exclusion
     Figure 5.6 shows a straightforward solution to the mutual exclusion problem using
     a semaphore s (compare Figure 5.1). Consider n processes, identified in the array
     P(i), all of which need access to the same resource. Each process has a critical sec-
     tion used to access the resource. In each process, a semWait(s) is executed just
     before its critical section. If the value of s becomes negative, the process is blocked.
     If the value is 1, then it is decremented to 0 and the process immediately enters its
     critical section; because s is no longer positive, no other process will be able to enter
     its critical section.
            The semaphore is initialized to 1. Thus, the first process that executes a
     semWait will be able to enter the critical section immediately, setting the value
     of s to 0. Any other process attempting to enter the critical section will find it busy
     and will be blocked, setting the value of s to ­1. Any number of processes may
     attempt entry; each such unsuccessful attempt results in a further decrement of the
     value of s. When the process that initially entered its critical section departs, s is
     incremented and one of the blocked processes (if any) is removed from the queue of
     blocked processes associated with the semaphore and put in a Ready state. When it
     is next scheduled by the OS, it may enter the critical section.
            Figure 5.7, based on one in [BACO03], shows a possible sequence for three
     processes using the mutual exclusion discipline of Figure 5.6. In this example three
     processes (A, B, C) access a shared resource protected by the semaphore lock.
     Process A executes semWait(lock); because the semaphore has a value of 1 at
     the time of the semWait operation, A can immediately enter its critical section and
     the semaphore takes on the value 0. While A is in its critical section, both B and C

Figure 5.7     Processes  Accessing  Shared  Data Protected by a Semaphore
perform a semWait operation and are blocked pending the availability of the sema-
phore. When A exits its critical section and performs semSignal(lock), B, which
was the first process in the queue, can now enter its critical section.
   The program of Figure 5.6 can equally well handle a requirement that more
than one process be allowed in its critical section at a time. This requirement is met
simply by initializing the semaphore to the specified value. Thus, at any time, the
value of s.count can be interpreted as follows:
·  s.count  0: s.count is the number of processes that can execute semWait(s)
   without suspension (if no semSignal(s) is executed in the meantime). Such
   situations will allow semaphores to support synchronization as well as mutual
   exclusion.
·  s.count < 0: The magnitude of s.count is the number of processes suspended in
   s.queue.
The Producer/Consumer Problem
We now examine one of the most common problems faced in concurrent process-
ing: the producer/consumer problem. The general statement is this: There are one
or more producers generating some type of data (records, characters) and placing

     these in a buffer. There is a single consumer that is taking items out of the buffer
     one at a time. The system is to be constrained to prevent the overlap of buffer oper-
     ations. That is, only one agent (producer or consumer) may access the buffer at any
     one time. The problem is to make sure that the producer won't try to add data into
     the buffer if it's full and that the consumer won't try to remove data from an empty
     buffer. We will look at a number of solutions to this problem to illustrate both the
     power and the pitfalls of semaphores.
     To begin, let us assume that the buffer is infinite and consists of a linear array
     of elements. In abstract terms, we can define the producer and consumer functions
     as follows:
     producer:                                     consumer:
     while        (true)   {                       while       (true)                              {
        /*        produce     item     v  */;         while                                   (in  <=  out)
        b[in]     =  v;                                                                   /*  do   nothing     */;
        in++;                                         w     =                             b[out];

     Figure 5.8 illustrates the structure of buffer b. The producer can generate
     items and store them in the buffer at its own pace. Each time, an index (in) into the
     buffer is incremented. The consumer proceeds in a similar fashion but must make
     sure that it does not attempt to read from an empty buffer. Hence, the consumer
     makes sure that the producer has advanced beyond it (in> out) before proceeding.
     Let us try to implement this system using binary semaphores. Figure 5.9 is a
     first attempt. Rather than deal with the indices in and out, we can simply keep track
     of the number of items in the buffer, using the integer variable n (= in ­ out). The
     semaphore s is used to enforce mutual exclusion; the semaphore delay is used to
     force the consumer to semWait if the buffer is empty.
     This solution seems rather straightforward. The producer is free to add
     to the buffer at any time. It performs semWaitB(s) before appending and
     semSignalB(s) afterward to prevent the consumer or any other producer from

Figure 5.9   An Incorrect Solution to the Infinite-Buffer    Producer/Consumer Problem
             Using Binary Semaphores
accessing the buffer during the append operation. Also, while in the critical section,
the producer increments the value of n. If n = 1, then the buffer was empty just prior
to this append, so the producer performs semSignalB(delay) to alert the con-
sumer of this fact. The consumer begins by waiting for the first item to be produced,
using semWaitB(delay). It then takes an item and decrements n in its critical
section. If the producer is able to stay ahead of the consumer (a common situation),
then the consumer will rarely block on the semaphore delay because n will usually
be positive. Hence both producer and consumer run smoothly.
    There is, however, a flaw in this program. When the consumer has exhausted
the buffer, it needs to reset the delay semaphore so that it will be forced to wait until
the producer has placed more items in the buffer. This is the purpose of the state-
ment: if     n == 0 semWaitB(delay). Consider the scenario outlined in Table 5.4.
In line 14, the consumer fails to execute the semWaitB operation. The consumer did
indeed exhaust the buffer and set n to 0 (line 8), but the producer has incremented n
before the consumer can test it in line 14. The result is a semSignalB not matched
by a prior semWaitB. The value of ­1 for n in line 20 means that the consumer has
consumed an item from the buffer that does not exist. It would not do simply to move
the conditional statement inside the critical section of the consumer because this
could lead to deadlock (e.g., after line 8 of Table 5.4).

Note: White areas represent the critical section controlled by semaphore s.
           A fix for the problem is to introduce an auxiliary variable that can be set in the
           consumer's critical section for use later on. This is shown in Figure 5.10. A careful
           trace of the logic should convince you that deadlock can no longer occur.
           A somewhat cleaner solution can be obtained if general semaphores (also
           called counting semaphores) are used, as shown in Figure 5.11. The variable n
           is now a semaphore. Its value still is equal to the number of items in the buffer.
           Suppose now that in transcribing this program, a mistake is made and the opera-
           tions semSignal(s) and semSignal(n) are interchanged. This would require
           that the semSignal(n) operation be performed in the producer's critical sec-
           tion without interruption by the consumer or another producer. Would this affect

the program? No, because the consumer must wait on both semaphores before
proceeding in any case.
    Now suppose that the semWait(n) and semWait(s) operations are acci-
dentally reversed. This produces a serious, indeed a fatal, flaw. If the consumer ever
enters its critical section when the buffer is empty (n.count = 0), then no producer
can ever append to the buffer and the system is deadlocked. This is a good example
of the subtlety of semaphores and the difficulty of producing correct designs.
    Finally, let us add a new and realistic restriction to the producer/consumer
problem: namely, that the buffer is finite. The buffer is treated as a circular storage
(Figure 5.12), and pointer values must be expressed modulo the size of the buffer.
The following relationships hold:
                                   Block on:                 Unblock on:
             Producer: insert in full buffer                 Consumer: item inserted
             Consumer: remove from empty buffer              Producer: item removed

                  Semaphores
            The producer and consumer functions can be expressed as follows (variable in
     and out are initialized to 0 and n is the size of the buffer):
         producer:                                                  consumer:

            /*    produce             item        v   */               while           (in   ==    out)
            while        ((in         +   1)      %   n   ==  out)            /*       do    nothing      */;
                     /*     do     nothing            */;              w   =  b[out];
            b[in]        =  v;                                         out    =        (out     +  1)  %  n;
            in    =  (in        +     1)    %     n;                   /*     consume           item   w  */;
         }                                                          }
            Figure 5.13 shows a solution using general semaphores. The semaphore e has
     been added to keep track of the number of empty spaces.
            Another instructive example in the use of semaphores is the barbershop prob-
     lem, described in Appendix A. Appendix A also includes additional examples of
     the problem of race conditions when using semaphores.
     Implementation of Semaphores
     As was mentioned earlier, it is imperative that the semWait and semSignal oper-
     ations be implemented as atomic primitives. One obvious way is to implement them

in hardware or firmware. Failing this, a variety of schemes have been suggested. The
essence of the problem is one of mutual exclusion: Only one process at a time may
manipulate a semaphore with either a semWait or semSignal operation. Thus,
any of the software schemes, such as Dekker's algorithm or Peterson's algorithm
(Appendix A), could be used; this would entail a substantial processing overhead.

Figure 5.14     Two Possible Implementations of Semaphores
          Another alternative is to use one of the hardware-supported schemes for mutual
          exclusion. For example, Figure 5.14a shows the use of a compare&swap instruc-
          tion. In this implementation, the semaphore is again a structure, as in Figure 5.3,
          but now includes a new integer component, s.flag. Admittedly, this involves a form
          of busy waiting. However, the semWait and semSignal operations are relatively
          short, so the amount of busy waiting involved should be minor.
                 For a single-processor system, it is possible to inhibit interrupts for the duration
          of a semWait or semSignal operation, as suggested in Figure 5.14b. Once again, the
          relatively short duration of these operations means that this approach is reasonable.
