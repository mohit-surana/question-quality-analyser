Problems
13.1   With reference to the device driver interface to the eCos kernel (Table 13.2), it is
       recommended that device drivers should use the _intsave() variants to claim and
       release spinlocks rather than the non-_intsave() variants. Explain why.
13.2   Also in Table 13.2, it is recommended that cyg_drv_spinlock_spin should be
       used sparingly, and in situations where deadlocks/livelocks cannot occur. Explain
       why.
13.3   In Table 13.2, what should be the limitations on the use of cyg_drv_spinlock_
       destroy? Explain.
13.4   In Table 13.2, what limitations should be placed in the use of cyg_drv_mutex_
       destroy?
13.5   Why does the eCos bitmap scheduler not support time slicing?
13.6   The implementation of mutexes within the eCos kernel does not support recursive
       locks. If a thread has locked a mutex and then attempts to lock the mutex again,
       typically as a result of some recursive call in a complicated call graph, then either an
       assertion failure will be reported or the thread will deadlock. Suggest a reason for
       this policy.
13.7   Figure 13.14 is a listing of code intended for use on the eCos kernel.
       a.  Explain the operation of the code. Assume thread B begins execution first and
           thread A begins to execute after some event occurs.
       b.  What would happen if the mutex unlock and wait code execution in the call to
           cyg_cond_wait, on line 30, were not atomic?
       c.  Why is the while loop on line 26 needed?
13.8   The discussion of eCos spinlocks included an example showing why spinlocks should
       not be used on a uniprocessor system if two threads of different priorities can com-
       pete for the same spinlock. Explain why the problem still exists even if only threads of
       the same priority can claim the same spinlock.
13.9   TinyOS's scheduler serves tasks in FIFO order. Many other schedulers for TinyOS
       have been proposed, but none have caught on. What characteristics of the sensornet
       domain might cause a lack of need for more complex scheduling?
13.10  a.  The TinyOS Resource interface does not allow a component that already has
           a request in the queue for a resource to make a second request. Suggest a
           reason.

                     b.     However, the TinyOS Resource interface allows a component holding the resource
                            lock to re-request the lock. This request is enqueued for a later grant. Suggest a
                            reason for this policy. Hint: What might cause there to be latency between one
                            component releasing a lock and the next requester being granted it?
