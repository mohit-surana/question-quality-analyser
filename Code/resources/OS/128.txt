   The concept of process is fundamental to the structure of modern
   computer operating systems. Its evolution in analyzing problems of
   synchronization, deadlock, and scheduling in operating systems has
   been a major intellectual contribution of computer science.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
     Define the term process and explain the relationship between processes and
      process control blocks.
     Explain the concept of a process state and discuss the state transitions the
      processes undergo.
     List and describe the purpose of the data structures and data structure
      elements used by an OS to manage processes.
     Assess the requirements for process control by the OS.
     Understand the issues involved in the execution of OS code.
     Assess the key security issues that relate to operating systems.
     Describe the process management scheme for UNIX SVR4.
All multiprogramming operating systems, from single-user systems such as Windows
for end users to mainframe systems such as IBM's mainframe operating system,
z/OS, which can support thousands of users, are built around the concept of the
process. Most requirements that the OS must meet can be expressed with reference
to processes:
     The OS must interleave the execution of multiple processes, to maximize pro-
      cessor utilization while providing reasonable response time.
     The OS must allocate resources to processes in conformance with a specific
      policy (e.g., certain functions or applications are of higher priority) while at
      the same time avoiding deadlock.1
     The OS may be required to support interprocess communication and user cre-
      ation of processes, both of which may aid in the structuring of applications.
      We begin with an examination of the way in which the OS represents and
controls processes. Then, the chapter discusses process states, which characterize
the behavior of processes. Then we look at the data structures that the OS uses to
manage processes. These include data structures to represent the state of each
1Deadlock is examined in Chapter 6. As a simple example, deadlock occurs if two processes need the
same two resources to continue and each has ownership of one. Unless some action is taken, each process
will wait indefinitely for the missing resource.

     process and data structures that record other characteristics of processes that the
     OS needs to achieve its objectives. Next, we look at the ways in which the OS uses
     these data structures to control process execution. Finally, we discuss process
     management in UNIX SVR4. Chapter 4 provides more modern examples of
     process management.
         This chapter occasionally refers to virtual memory. Much of the time, we can
     ignore this concept in dealing with processes, but at certain points in the discus-
     sion, virtual memory considerations are pertinent. Virtual memory is previewed in
     Chapter 2 and discussed in detail in Chapter 8. A set of animations that illustrate
     concepts in this chapter is available online. Click on the rotating globe at this book's
