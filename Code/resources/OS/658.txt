        Problems
        14.1     Consider an automated teller machine (ATM) in which users provide a personal iden-
                 tification number (PIN) and a card for account access. Give examples of confidenti-
                 ality, integrity, and availability requirements associated with the system and, in each
                 case, indicate the degree of importance of the requirement.
        14.2     Repeat the preceding problem for a telephone switching system that routes calls
                 through a switching network based on the telephone number requested by the caller.
        14.3     Consider a desktop     publishing  system    used    to  produce     documents  for  various
                 organizations.
                 a.  Give an example of a type of publication for which confidentiality of the stored
                     data is the most important requirement.
                 b.  Give an example of a type of publication in which data integrity is the most impor-
                     tant requirement.
                 c.  Give an example in which system availability is the most important requirement.

14.4  For each of the following assets, assign a low, moderate, or high impact level for the
      loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity, respectively. Justify your answers.
      a.  An organization managing public information on its Web server.
      b.  A  law  enforcement    organization  managing    extremely    sensitive  investigative
          information.
      c.  A financial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy-
          related information).
      d.  An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting organization
          contains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine
          administrative information. Assess the impact for the two data sets separately and
          the information system as a whole.
      e.  A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition)
          system controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military installation.
          The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administra-
          tive information. Assess the impact for the two data sets separately and the infor-
          mation system as a whole.
14.5  Assume that passwords are selected from four-character combinations of 26 alpha-
      betic characters. Assume that an adversary is able to attempt passwords at a rate of
      one per second.
      a.  Assuming no feedback to the adversary until each attempt has been completed,
          what is the expected time to discover the correct password?
      b.  Assuming feedback to the adversary flagging an error as each incorrect character
          is entered, what is the expected time to discover the correct password?
14.6  There is a flaw in the virus program of Figure 14.1. What is it?
14.7  The question arises as to whether it is possible to develop a program that can analyze
      a piece of software to determine if it is a virus. Consider that we have a program D
      that is supposed to be able to do that. That is, for any program P, if we run D(P), the
      result returned is TRUE (P is a virus) or FALSE (P is not a virus). Now consider the
      following program:
                  Program    CV     :=
                     {  ...
                     main-program       :=
                                 {if    D(CV)  then   goto  next:
                                            else  infect-executable;
                                 }
                  next:
                  }
      In the preceding program, infect-executable is a module that scans memory for exe-
      cutable programs and replicates itself in those programs. Determine if D can correctly
      decide whether CV is a virus.
14.8  The point of this problem is to demonstrate the type of puzzles that must be solved in
      the design of malicious code and therefore, the type of mind-set that one wishing to
      counter such attacks must adopt.
      a.  Consider the following C program:
                  begin
                         print      (*begin    print  ();   end.*);
                  end
          What do you think the program was intended to do? Does it work?

            b.  Answer the same questions for the following program:
                char [] = {'0', ' ', '}', ';', 'm', 'a',               'i',  'n',  '(',  ')',  '{',
                and so on...  't',    ')',    '0'};
                main          ()
                {
                      int         I;
                      printf(*char            t[]     =   (*);
                      for         (i=0;  t[i]!=0;         i=i+1)
                                  printf("%d,         ",  t[i]);
                      printf("%s",            t);
                }
            c.  What is the specific relevance of this problem to this chapter?
     14.9   Consider the following fragment:
                legitimate            code
                if    data        is  Friday  the        13th;
                      crash_computer();
                legitimate            code
            What type of malicious software is this?
     14.10  Consider the following fragment in an authentication program:
                username          =   read_username();
                password          =   read_password();
                if    username        is      "133t   h4ck0r"
                      return          ALLOW_LOGIN;
                if    username        and     password    are     valid
                      return          ALLOW_LOGIN
                else  return          DENY_LOGIN
            What type of malicious software is this?
     14.11  The following code fragments show a sequence of virus instructions and a polymor-
            phic version of the virus. Describe the effect produced by the metamorphic code.
                Original Code                      Metamorphic Code
                mov   eax,    5                    mov    eax,    5
                add   eax,    ebx                  push   ecx
                call  [eax]                        pop    ecx
                                                   add    eax,    ebx
                                                   swap   eax,       ebx
                                                   swap   ebx,       eax
                                                   call   [eax]
                                                   nop
