Dining Philosophers Problem
6.6  DINING PHILOSOPHERS PROBLEM
     We now turn to the dining philosophers problem, introduced by Dijkstra [DIJK71].
     Five philosophers live in a house, where a table is laid for them. The life of each phi-
     losopher consists principally of thinking and eating, and through years of thought,
     all of the philosophers had agreed that the only food that contributed to their think-
     ing efforts was spaghetti. Due to a lack of manual skill, each philosopher requires
     two forks to eat spaghetti.
     The eating arrangements are simple (Figure 6.11): a round table on which is
     set a large serving bowl of spaghetti, five plates, one for each philosopher, and five
     forks. A philosopher wishing to eat goes to his or her assigned place at the table
     and, using the two forks on either side of the plate, takes and eats some spaghetti.
     The problem: Devise a ritual (algorithm) that will allow the philosophers to eat. The
     algorithm must satisfy mutual exclusion (no two philosophers can use the same fork
     at the same time) while avoiding deadlock and starvation (in this case, the term has
     literal as well as algorithmic meaning!).
     This problem may not seem important or relevant in itself. However, it does
     illustrate basic problems in deadlock and starvation. Furthermore, attempts to
     develop solutions reveal many of the difficulties in concurrent programming (e.g.,
     see [GING90]). In addition, the dining philosophers problem can be seen as repre-
     sentative of problems dealing with the coordination of shared resources, which may
                                                P2
                                  P3                    P1
                                      P4            P0

      occur when an application includes concurrent threads of execution. Accordingly,
      this problem is a standard test case for evaluating approaches to synchronization.
      Solution Using Semaphores
      Figure 6.12 suggests a solution using semaphores. Each philosopher picks up first
      the fork on the left and then the fork on the right. After the philosopher is finished
      eating, the two forks are replaced on the table. This solution, alas, leads to deadlock:
      If all of the philosophers are hungry at the same time, they all sit down, they all pick
      up the fork on their left, and they all reach out for the other fork, which is not there.
      In this undignified position, all philosophers starve.
             To overcome the risk of deadlock, we could buy five additional forks (a more
      sanitary solution!) or teach the philosophers to eat spaghetti with just one fork.
      As another approach, we could consider adding an attendant who only allows four
      philosophers at a time into the dining room. With at most four seated philosophers,
      at least one philosopher will have access to two forks. Figure 6.13 shows such a solu-
      tion, again using semaphores. This solution is free of deadlock and starvation.
      Solution Using a Monitor
      Figure 6.14 shows a solution to the dining philosophers problem using a monitor. A
      vector of five condition variables is defined, one condition variable per fork. These
      condition variables are used to enable a philosopher to wait for the availability of a
      fork. In addition, there is a Boolean vector that records the availability status of each
      fork (true means the fork is available). The monitor consists of two procedures.
      The get_forks procedure is used by a philosopher to seize his or her left and
/*   program    diningphilosophers           */
semaphore     fork  [5]     =  {1};
int   i;
void  philosopher     (int     i)
{
      while   (true)     {
              think();
              wait  (fork[i]);
              wait  (fork      [(i+1)  mod   5]);
              eat();
              signal(fork      [(i+1)  mod   5]);
              signal(fork[i]);
      }
}
void  main()
{
      parbegin      (philosopher       (0),  philosopher          (1),
              philosopher      (2),    philosopher                (3),
              philosopher      (4));
      }

int   i;

      while     (true)      {
                think();
                wait     (room);
                wait     (fork[i]);
                wait     (fork    [(i+1)  mod   5]);
                eat();
                signal      (fork  [(i+1)  mod      5]);
                signal      (fork[i]);
                signal      (room);
      }
}

      parbegin           (philosopher     (0),  philosopher        (1),
                philosopher        (2),   philosopher     (3),

      right forks. If either fork is unavailable, the philosopher process is queued on the
      appropriate condition variable. This enables another philosopher process to enter
      the monitor. The release-forks procedure is used to make two forks available.
      Note that the structure of this solution is similar to that of the semaphore solution
      proposed in Figure 6.12. In both cases, a philosopher seizes first the left fork and
      then the right fork. Unlike the semaphore solution, this monitor solution does not
      suffer from deadlock, because only one process at a time may be in the monitor. For
      example, the first philosopher process to enter the monitor is guaranteed that it can
      pick up the right fork after it picks up the left fork before the next philosopher to the
      right has a chance to seize its left fork, which is this philosopher's right fork.

      UNIX provides a variety of mechanisms for interprocessor communication and syn-
      chronization. Here, we look at the most important of these:
               Pipes
               Messages
               Shared memory
               Semaphores
               Signals
