Secondary Storage Management

      On secondary storage, a file consists of a collection of blocks. The operating system
      or file management system is responsible for allocating blocks to files. This raises
      two management issues. First, space on secondary storage must be allocated to files,
      and second, it is necessary to keep track of the space available for allocation. We
      will see that these two tasks are related; that is, the approach taken for file alloca-
      tion may influence the approach taken for free space management. Further, we will
      see that there is an interaction between file structure and allocation policy.
          We begin this section by looking at alternatives for file allocation on a single
      disk. Then we look at the issue of free space management, and finally we discuss
      reliability.
      File Allocation
      Several issues are involved in file allocation:
      1.  When a new file is created, is the maximum space required for the file allo-
          cated at once?
      2.  Space is allocated to a file as one or more contiguous units, which we shall
          refer to as portions. That is, a portion is a contiguous set of allocated blocks.
          The size of a portion can range from a single block to the entire file. What size
          of portion should be used for file allocation?
      3.  What sort of data structure or table is used to keep track of the portions
          assigned to a file? An example of such a structure is a file allocation table
          (FAT), found on DOS and some other systems.
      Let us examine these issues in turn.
      PREALLOCATION VERSUS DYNAMIC ALLOCATION             A preallocation policy requires
      that the maximum size of a file be declared at the time of the file creation request.
      In a number of cases, such as program compilations, the production of summary
      data files, or the transfer of a file from another system over a communications
      network, this value can be reliably estimated. However, for many applications, it
      is difficult if not impossible to estimate reliably the maximum potential size of the
      file. In those cases, users and application programmers would tend to overestimate

     file size so as not to run out of space. This clearly is wasteful from the point of view
     of secondary storage allocation. Thus, there are advantages to the use of dynamic
     allocation, which allocates space to a file in portions as needed.
     PORTION SIZE  The second issue listed is that of the size of the portion allocated to a
     file. At one extreme, a portion large enough to hold the entire file is allocated. At the
     other extreme, space on the disk is allocated one block at a time. In choosing a portion
     size, there is a trade-off between efficiency from the point of view of a single file versus
     overall system efficiency. [WIED87] lists four items to be considered in the trade-off:
     1.  Contiguity of space increases performance, especially for Retrieve_Next
         operations, and greatly for transactions running in a transaction-oriented
         operating system.
     2.  Having a large number of small portions increases the size of tables needed to
         manage the allocation information.
     3.  Having fixed-size portions (e.g., blocks) simplifies the reallocation of space.
     4.  Having variable-size or small fixed-size portions minimizes waste of unused
         storage due to overallocation.
         Of course, these items interact and must be considered together. The result is
     that there are two major alternatives:
     ·   Variable, large contiguous portions: This will provide better performance. The
         variable size avoids waste, and the file allocation tables are small. However,
         space is hard to reuse.
     ·   Blocks: Small fixed portions provide greater flexibility. They may require
         large tables or complex structures for their allocation. Contiguity has been
         abandoned as a primary goal; blocks are allocated as needed.
         Either option is compatible with preallocation or dynamic allocation. In
     the case of variable, large contiguous portions, a file is preallocated one contigu-
     ous group of blocks. This eliminates the need for a file allocation table; all that is
     required is a pointer to the first block and the number of blocks allocated. In the
     case of blocks, all of the portions required are allocated at one time. This means that
     the file allocation table for the file will remain of fixed size, because the number of
     blocks allocated is fixed.
         With variable-size portions, we need to be concerned with the fragmentation
     of free space. This issue was faced when we considered partitioned main memory in
     Chapter 7. The following are possible alternative strategies:
     ·   First fit: Choose the first unused contiguous group of blocks of sufficient size
         from a free block list.
     ·   Best fit: Choose the smallest unused group that is of sufficient size.
     ·   Nearest fit: Choose the unused group of sufficient size that is closest to the
         previous allocation for the file to increase locality.
         It is not clear which strategy is best. The difficulty in modeling alternative
     strategies is that so many factors interact, including types of files, pattern of file

FILE ALLOCATION METHODS                            Having looked at the issues of preallocation versus
dynamic allocation and portion size, we are in a position to consider specific file
allocation methods. Three methods are in common use: contiguous, chained, and
indexed. summarizes some of the characteristics of each method.
                With contiguous allocation, a single contiguous set of blocks is allocated to a
file at the time of file creation (Figure 12.9). Thus, this is a preallocation strategy,
using variable-size portions. The file allocation table needs just a single entry for
each file, showing the starting block and the length of the file. Contiguous allocation
is the best from the point of view of the individual sequential file. Multiple blocks
can be read in at a time to improve I/O performance for sequential processing. It is
also easy to retrieve a single block. For example, if a file starts at block b, and the
ith block of the file is wanted, its location on secondary storage is simply b + i ­ 1.
Contiguous allocation presents some problems. External fragmentation will occur,
making it difficult to find contiguous blocks of space of sufficient length. From time
                                                                                  File allocation table

     to time, it will be necessary to perform a compaction algorithm to free up additional
     space on the disk (Figure 12.10). Also, with preallocation, it is necessary to declare
     the size of the file at the time of creation, with the problems mentioned earlier.
     At the opposite extreme from contiguous allocation is chained allocation
     (Figure 12.11). Typically, allocation is on an individual block basis. Each block con-
     tains a pointer to the next block in the chain. Again, the file allocation table needs
     just a single entry for each file, showing the starting block and the length of the
     file. Although preallocation is possible, it is more common simply to allocate blocks
     as needed. The selection of blocks is now a simple matter: Any free block can be
     added to a chain. There is no external fragmentation to worry about because only
                                                                  File allocation table

Figure 12.12  Chained Allocation (After Consolidation)
one block at a time is needed. This type of physical organization is best suited to
sequential files that are to be processed sequentially. To select an individual block
of a file requires tracing through the chain to the desired block.
One consequence of chaining, as described so far, is that there is no accommo-
dation of the principle of locality. Thus, if it is necessary to bring in several blocks of
a file at a time, as in sequential processing, then a series of accesses to different parts
of the disk are required. This is perhaps a more significant effect on a single-user
system but may also be of concern on a shared system. To overcome this problem,
some systems periodically consolidate files (Figure 12.12).
Indexed allocation addresses many of the problems of contiguous and chained
allocation. In this case, the file allocation table contains a separate one-level index for
each file; the index has one entry for each portion allocated to the file. Typically, the
file indexes are not physically stored as part of the file allocation table. Rather, the
file index for a file is kept in a separate block, and the entry for the file in the file allo-
cation table points to that block. Allocation may be on the basis of either fixed-size
blocks (Figure 12.13) or variable-size portions (Figure 12.14). Allocation by blocks
eliminates external fragmentation, whereas allocation by variable-size portions
improves locality. In either case, file consolidation may be done from time to time.
File consolidation reduces the size of the index in the case of variable-size portions,
but not in the case of block allocation. Indexed allocation supports both sequential
and direct access to the file and thus is the most popular form of file allocation.
Free Space Management
Just as the space that is allocated to files must be managed, so the space that is not
currently allocated to any file must be managed. To perform any of the file alloca-
tion techniques described previously, it is necessary to know what blocks on the disk
are available. Thus we need a disk allocation table in addition to a file allocation
table. We discuss here a number of techniques that have been implemented.

                                                                   File       allocation table

     BIT TABLES  This method uses a vector containing one bit for each block on the
     disk. Each entry of a 0 corresponds to a free block, and each 1 corresponds to a
     block in use. For example, for the disk layout of Figure 12.9, a vector of length 35 is
     needed and would have the following value:
                                 00111000011111000011111111111011000
     A bit table has the advantage that it is relatively easy to find one or a con-
     tiguous group of free blocks. Thus, a bit table works well with any of the file
     allocation methods outlined. Another advantage is that it is as small as possible.

However, it can still be sizable. The amount of memory (in bytes) required for a
block bitmap is
                              disk size in bytes
                              8 * file system block size
Thus, for a 16-Gbyte disk with 512-byte blocks, the bit table occupies about
4 Mbytes. Can we spare 4 Mbytes of main memory for the bit table? If so, then the
bit table can be searched without the need for disk access. But even with today's
memory sizes, 4 Mbytes is a hefty chunk of main memory to devote to a single func-
tion. The alternative is to put the bit table on disk. But a 4-Mbyte bit table would
require about 8,000 disk blocks. We can't afford to search that amount of disk space
every time a block is needed, so a bit table resident in memory is indicated.
Even when the bit table is in main memory, an exhaustive search of the table
can slow file system performance to an unacceptable degree. This is especially true
when the disk is nearly full and there are few free blocks remaining. Accordingly,
most file systems that use bit tables maintain auxiliary data structures that sum-
marize the contents of subranges of the bit table. For example, the table could be
divided logically into a number of equal-size subranges. A summary table could
include, for each subrange, the number of free blocks and the maximum-sized con-
tiguous number of free blocks. When the file system needs a number of contiguous
blocks, it can scan the summary table to find an appropriate subrange and then
search that subrange.
CHAINED FREE PORTIONS         The free portions may be chained together by using
a pointer and length value in each free portion. This method has negligible space
overhead because there is no need for a disk allocation table, merely for a pointer to
the beginning of the chain and the length of the first portion. This method is suited
to all of the file allocation methods. If allocation is a block at a time, simply choose
the free block at the head of the chain and adjust the first pointer or length value.
If allocation is by variable-length portion, a first-fit algorithm may be used: The
headers from the portions are fetched one at a time to determine the next suitable
free portion in the chain. Again, pointer and length values are adjusted.
This method has its own problems. After some use, the disk will become quite
fragmented and many portions will be a single block long. Also note that every
time you allocate a block, you need to read the block first to recover the pointer to
the new first free block before writing data to that block. If many individual blocks
need to be allocated at one time for a file operation, this greatly slows file creation.
Similarly, deleting highly fragmented files is very time consuming.
INDEXING  The indexing approach treats free space as a file and uses an index table
as described under file allocation. For efficiency, the index should be on the basis
of variable-size portions rather than blocks. Thus, there is one entry in the table for
every free portion on the disk. This approach provides efficient support for all of
the file allocation methods.
FREE BLOCK LIST        In this method, each block is assigned a number sequentially
and the list of the numbers of all free blocks is maintained in a reserved portion of

     the disk. Depending on the size of the disk, either 24 or 32 bits will be needed to
     store a single block number, so the size of the free block list is 24 or 32 times the size
     of the corresponding bit table and thus must be stored on disk rather than in main
     memory. However, this is a satisfactory method. Consider the following points:
     1.  The space on disk devoted to the free block list is less than 1% of the total disk
         space. If a 32-bit block number is used, then the space penalty is 4 bytes for
         every 512-byte block.
     2.  Although the free block list is too large to store in main memory, there are
         two effective techniques for storing a small part of the list in main memory.
         a.  The list can be treated as a push-down stack (Appendix P) with the first
             few thousand elements of the stack kept in main memory. When a new
             block is allocated, it is popped from the top of the stack, which is in main
             memory. Similarly, when a block is deallocated, it is pushed onto the stack.
             There only has to be a transfer between disk and main memory when the
             in-memory portion of the stack becomes either full or empty. Thus, this
             technique gives almost zero-time access most of the time.
         b.  The list can be treated as a FIFO queue, with a few thousand entries from
             both the head and the tail of the queue in main memory. A block is allo-
             cated by taking the first entry from the head of the queue and deallocated
             by adding it to the end of the tail of the queue. There only has to be a trans-
             fer between disk and main memory when either the in-memory portion of
             the head of the queue becomes empty or the in-memory portion of the tail
             of the queue becomes full.
         In either of the strategies listed in the preceding point (stack or FIFO queue),
     a background thread can slowly sort the in-memory list or lists to facilitate contigu-
     ous allocation.
     Volumes
     The term volume is used somewhat differently by different operating systems and
     file management systems, but in essence a volume is a logical disk. [CARR05]
     defines a volume as follows:
     Volume: A collection of addressable sectors in secondary memory that an OS or
     application can use for data storage. The sectors in a volume need not be con-
     secutive on a physical storage device; instead, they need only appear that way to
     the OS or application. A volume may be the result of assembling and merging
     smaller volumes.
         In the simplest case, a single disk equals one volume. Frequently, a disk is
     divided into partitions, with each partition functioning as a separate volume. It is
     also common to treat multiple disks as a single volume or partitions on multiple
     disks as a single volume.

      Reliability
      Consider the following scenario:
      1.  User A requests a file allocation to add to an existing file.
      2.  The request is granted and the disk and file allocation tables are updated in
          main memory but not yet on disk.
      3.  The system crashes and subsequently restarts.
      4.  User B requests a file allocation and is allocated space on disk that overlaps
          the last allocation to user A.
      5.  User A accesses the overlapped portion via a reference that is stored inside
          A's file.
          This difficulty arose because the system maintained a copy of the disk alloca-
      tion table and file allocation table in main memory for efficiency. To prevent this type
      of error, the following steps could be performed when a file allocation is requested:
      1.  Lock the disk allocation table on disk. This prevents another user from causing
          alterations to the table until this allocation is completed.
      2.  Search the disk allocation table for available space. This assumes that a copy
          of the disk allocation table is always kept in main memory. If not, it must first
          be read in.
      3.  Allocate space, update the disk allocation table, and update the disk. Updating
          the disk involves writing the disk allocation table back onto disk. For chained
          disk allocation, it also involves updating some pointers on disk.
      4.  Update the file allocation table and update the disk.
      5.  Unlock the disk allocation table.
          This technique will prevent errors. However, when small portions are allo-
      cated frequently, the impact on performance will be substantial. To reduce this
      overhead, a batch storage allocation scheme could be used. In this case, a batch of
      free portions on the disk is obtained for allocation. The corresponding portions on
      disk are marked "in use." Allocation using this batch may proceed in main memory.
      When the batch is exhausted, the disk allocation table is updated on disk and a new
      batch may be acquired. If a system crash occurs, portions on the disk marked "in
      use" must be cleaned up in some fashion before they can be reallocated. The tech-
      nique for cleanup will depend on the file system's particular characteristics.
