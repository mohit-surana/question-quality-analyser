Distributed Message Passing
                                            16.3 / DISTRIBUTED MESSAGE PASSING                691
       Discoverable: Services need to be found at both design time and run time, not
         only by unique identity but also by interface identity and by service kind.
        Single instance: Unlike component-based development, which instantiates
         components as needed, each service is a single, always running instance that a
         number of clients communicate with.
        Loosely coupled: Services are connected to other services and clients using
         standard, dependency-reducing, decoupled message-based methods such as
         XML document exchanges.
        Asynchronous: In general, services use an asynchronous message-passing
         approach; however, this is not required. In fact, many services will use syn-
         chronous message passing at times.
         To give the reader some feel for the use of SOA, we look at an example. Figure
      16.11a shows a common approach to building applications targeted at specific user
      categories. For each specific application, a single self-contained application module
      is built. What ties together the various applications in the enterprise is an applica-
      tion-independent database management system that supports a number of databases.
      Multiple applications may have access to a single database. For example, in this
      configuration all three applications require access to a customer information data-
      base. The advantages of this arrangement are clear. By separating the data from the
      applications and providing a uniform database interface, multiple applications can
      be developed and revised independently from one another.
         This typical approach, of a variety of applications using a common set of data-
      bases, has some drawbacks. The addition of a new feature or user service, such as
      ATM, generally requires building a new application independent of existing appli-
      cations. This is despite the fact that much of the necessary logic has already been
      implemented in related applications.
         We can achieve greater efficiency and flexibility by migrating to an SOA, as
      shown in Figure 16.11b. Here, the strategy is to isolate services that may be of com-
      mon use to multiple applications and implement these as separate service modules.
      In this particular example of the SOA, there are some core applications that deal
      with the functionality of individual databases. These applications are accessible by
      application programming interfaces by service modules that implement common
      services. Finally, the specific applications visible to users deal primarily with presen-
      tation issues and with specific business logic.
16.3  DISTRIBUTED MESSAGE PASSING
      It is usually the case in a distributed processing systems that the computers do not
      share main memory; each is an isolated computer system. Thus, interprocessor com-
      munication techniques that rely on shared memory, such as semaphores, cannot be
      used. Instead, techniques that rely on message passing are used. In this section and
      the next, we look at the two most common approaches. The first is the straightfor-
      ward application of messages as they are used in a single system. The second is a
      separate technique that relies on message passing as a basic function: the remote
      procedure call.

Figure 16.12a shows the use of message passing to implement client/server
functionality. A client process requires some service (e.g., read a file, print) and
sends a message containing a request for service to a server process. The server
process honors the request and sends a message containing a reply. In its simplest
form, only two functions are needed: Send and Receive. The Send function speci-
fies a destination and includes the message content. The Receive function tells from
whom a message is desired (including "all") and provides a buffer where the incom-
ing message is to be stored.
Figure 16.13 suggests an implementation for message passing. Processes make
use of the services of a message-passing module. Service requests can be expressed in
terms of primitives and parameters. A primitive specifies the function to be performed,
and the parameters are used to pass data and control information. The actual form of
a primitive depends on the message-passing software. It may be a procedure call, or it
may itself be a message to a process that is part of the operating system.

     Figure 16.13              Basic Message-Passing Primitives
     The Send primitive is used by the process that desires to send the message.
     Its parameters are the identifier of the destination process and the contents of the
     message. The message-passing module constructs a data unit that includes these two
     elements. This data unit is sent to the machine that hosts the destination process,
     using some sort of communications facility, such as TCP/IP. When the data unit
     is received in the target system, it is routed by the communications facility to the
     message-passing module. This module examines the process ID field and stores the
     message in the buffer for that process.
     In this scenario, the receiving process must announce its willingness to receive
     messages by designating a buffer area and informing the message-passing module
     by a Receive primitive. An alternative approach does not require such an announce-
     ment. Instead, when the message-passing module receives a message, it signals the
     destination process with some sort of Receive signal and then makes the received
     message available in a shared buffer.
     Several design issues are associated with distributed message passing, and
     these are addressed in the remainder of this section.
     Reliability versus Unreliability
     A reliable message-passing facility is one that guarantees delivery if possible. Such
     a facility makes use of a reliable transport protocol or similar logic and performs
     error checking, acknowledgment, retransmission, and reordering of misordered
     messages. Because delivery is guaranteed, it is not necessary to let the sending
     process know that the message was delivered. However, it might be useful to pro-
     vide an acknowledgment back to the sending process so that it knows that deliv-
     ery has already taken place. In either case, if the facility fails to achieve delivery
     (e.g., persistent network failure, crash of destination system), the sending process is
     notified of the failure.
     At the other extreme, the message-passing facility may simply send the mes-
     sage out into the communications network but will report neither success nor
     failure. This alternative greatly reduces the complexity and processing and com-
     munications overhead of the message-passing facility. For those applications that

                                   16.4 / REMOTE PROCEDURE CALLS                            695
      require confirmation that a message has been delivered, the applications them-
      selves may use request and reply messages to satisfy the requirement.
      Blocking versus Nonblocking
      With nonblocking, or asynchronous, primitives, a process is not suspended as a
      result of issuing a Send or Receive. Thus, when a process issues a Send primi-
      tive, the operating system returns control to the process as soon as the message
      has been queued for transmission or a copy has been made. If no copy is made,
      any changes made to the message by the sending process before or even while it
      is being transmitted are made at the risk of the process. When the message has
      been transmitted or copied to a safe place for subsequent transmission, the send-
      ing process is interrupted to be informed that the message buffer may be reused.
      Similarly, a nonblocking Receive is issued by a process that then proceeds to run.
      When a message arrives, the process is informed by interrupt, or it can poll for
      status periodically.
          Nonblocking primitives provide for efficient, flexible use of the message-
      passing facility by processes. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is difficult
      to test and debug programs that use these primitives. Irreproducible, timing-
      dependent sequences can create subtle and difficult problems.
          The alternative is to use blocking, or synchronous, primitives. A blocking
      Send does not return control to the sending process until the message has been
      transmitted (unreliable service) or until the message has been sent and an acknowl-
      edgment received (reliable service). A blocking Receive does not return control
      until a message has been placed in the allocated buffer.
16.4  REMOTE PROCEDURE CALLS
      A variation on the basic message-passing model is the remote procedure call. This
      is now a widely accepted and common method for encapsulating communica-
      tion in a distributed system. The essence of the technique is to allow programs on
      different machines to interact using simple procedure call/return semantics, just as
      if the two programs were on the same machine. That is, the procedure call is used
      for access to remote services. The popularity of this approach is due to the following
      advantages.
      1.  The procedure call is a widely accepted, used, and understood abstraction.
      2.  The use of remote procedure calls enables remote interfaces to be specified
          as a set of named operations with designated types. Thus, the interface can
          be clearly documented and distributed programs can be statically checked for
          type errors.
      3.  Because a standardized and precisely defined interface is specified, the
          communication code for an application can be generated automatically.
      4.  Because a standardized and precisely defined interface is specified, develop-
          ers can write client and server modules that can be moved among computers
          and operating systems with little modification and recoding.
