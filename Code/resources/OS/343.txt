Paging

     of the program; these values must be set when the program is loaded into memory or
     when the process image is swapped in. During the course of execution of the proc-
     ess, relative addresses are encountered. These include the contents of the instruc-
     tion register, instruction addresses that occur in branch and call instructions, and
     data addresses that occur in load and store instructions. Each such relative address
     goes through two steps of manipulation by the processor. First, the value in the base
     register is added to the relative address to produce an absolute address. Second, the
     resulting address is compared to the value in the bounds register. If the address is
     within bounds, then the instruction execution may proceed. Otherwise, an interrupt is
     generated to the operating system, which must respond to the error in some fashion.
     The scheme of Figure 7.8 allows programs to be swapped in and out of mem-
     ory during the course of execution. It also provides a measure of protection: Each
     process image is isolated by the contents of the base and bounds registers and safe
     from unwanted accesses by other processes.
7.3  PAGING
     Both unequal fixed-size and variable-size partitions are inefficient in the use of
     memory; the former results in internal fragmentation, the latter in external frag-
     mentation. Suppose, however, that main memory is partitioned into equal fixed-size
     chunks that are relatively small, and that each process is also divided into small
     fixed-size chunks of the same size. Then the chunks of a process, known as pages,
     could be assigned to available chunks of memory, known as frames, or page frames.
     We show in this section that the wasted space in memory for each process is due
     to internal fragmentation consisting of only a fraction of the last page of a process.
     There is no external fragmentation.
     Figure 7.9 illustrates the use of pages and frames. At a given point in time, some
     of the frames in memory are in use and some are free. A list of free frames is main-
     tained by the OS. Process A, stored on disk, consists of four pages. When it is time to
     load this process, the OS finds four free frames and loads the four pages of process A
     into the four frames (Figure 7.9b). Process B, consisting of three pages, and process C,
     consisting of four pages, are subsequently loaded. Then process B is suspended and is
     swapped out of main memory. Later, all of the processes in main memory are blocked,
     and the OS needs to bring in a new process, process D, which consists of five pages.
     Now suppose, as in this example, that there are not sufficient unused contiguous
     frames to hold the process. Does this prevent the operating system from loading D?
     The answer is no, because we can once again use the concept of logical address.
     A simple base address register will no longer suffice. Rather, the operating system
     maintains a page table for each process. The page table shows the frame location for
     each page of the process. Within the program, each logical address consists of a page
     number and an offset within the page. Recall that in the case of simple partition, a
     logical address is the location of a word relative to the beginning of the program; the
     processor translates that into a physical address. With paging, the logical-to-physical
     address translation is still done by processor hardware. Now the processor must
     know how to access the page table of the current process. Presented with a logical

     address (page number, offset), the processor uses the page table to produce a physi-
     cal address (frame number, offset).
     Continuing our example, the five pages of process D are loaded into frames 4,
     5, 6, 11, and 12. Figure 7.10 shows the various page tables at this time. A page table
     contains one entry for each page of the process, so that the table is easily indexed by
     the page number (starting at page 0). Each page table entry contains the number of
     the frame in main memory, if any, that holds the corresponding page. In addition,
     the OS maintains a single free-frame list of all the frames in main memory that are
     currently unoccupied and available for pages.
     Thus we see that simple paging, as described here, is similar to fixed parti-
     tioning. The differences are that, with paging, the partitions are rather small; a

program may occupy more than one partition; and these partitions need not be
contiguous.
                             To make this paging scheme convenient, let us dictate that the page size,
hence the frame size, must be a power of 2. With the use of a page size that is a
power of 2, it is easy to demonstrate that the relative address, which is defined with
reference to the origin of the program, and the logical address, expressed as a page
number and offset, are the same. An example is shown in Figure 7.11. In this exam-
ple, 16-bit addresses are used, and the page size is 1K  1,024 bytes. The relative
address 1502, in binary form, is 0000010111011110. With a page size of 1K, an offset
field of 10 bits is needed, leaving 6 bits for the page number. Thus a program can
consist of a maximum of 26  64 pages of 1K bytes each. As Figure 7.11b shows, rel-
ative address 1502 corresponds to an offset of 478 (0111011110) on page 1 (000001),
which yields the same 16-bit number, 0000010111011110.
                             The consequences of using a page size that is a power of 2 are twofold. First,
the logical addressing scheme is transparent to the programmer, the assembler, and

     the linker. Each logical address (page number, offset) of a program is identical to
     its relative address. Second, it is a relatively easy matter to implement a function in
     hardware to perform dynamic address translation at run time. Consider an address
     of n + m bits, where the leftmost n bits are the page number and the rightmost m
     bits are the offset. In our example (Figure 7.11b), n  6 and m  10. The following
     steps are needed for address translation:
     ·  Extract the page number as the leftmost n bits of the logical address.
     ·  Use the page number as an index into the process page table to find the frame
        number, k.
     ·  The starting physical address of the frame is k × 2m, and the physical address
        of the referenced byte is that number plus the offset. This physical address
        need not be calculated; it is easily constructed by appending the frame number
        to the offset.
        In our example, we have the logical address 0000010111011110, which is page
     number 1, offset 478. Suppose that this page is residing in main memory frame
     6  binary 000110. Then the physical address is frame number 6, offset 478 
     0001100111011110 (Figure 7.12a).

        To summarize, with simple paging, main memory is divided into many small
     equal-size frames. Each process is divided into frame-size pages. Smaller processes
     require fewer pages; larger processes require more. When a process is brought in,
     all of its pages are loaded into available frames, and a page table is set up. This
     approach solves many of the problems inherent in partitioning.
7.4  SEGMENTATION
     A user program can be subdivided using segmentation, in which the program and its
     associated data are divided into a number of segments. It is not required that all seg-
     ments of all programs be of the same length, although there is a maximum segment
     length. As with paging, a logical address using segmentation consists of two parts, in
     this case a segment number and an offset.
        Because of the use of unequal-size segments, segmentation is similar to
     dynamic partitioning. In the absence of an overlay scheme or the use of virtual
     memory, it would be required that all of a program's segments be loaded into mem-
     ory for execution. The difference, compared to dynamic partitioning, is that with
     segmentation a program may occupy more than one partition, and these partitions
     need not be contiguous. Segmentation eliminates internal fragmentation but, like
     dynamic partitioning, it suffers from external fragmentation. However, because a
     process is broken up into a number of smaller pieces, the external fragmentation
     should be less.
        Whereas paging is invisible to the programmer, segmentation is usually visible
     and is provided as a convenience for organizing programs and data. Typically, the
     programmer or compiler will assign programs and data to different segments. For
     purposes of modular programming, the program or data may be further broken
     down into multiple segments. The principal inconvenience of this service is that the
     programmer must be aware of the maximum segment size limitation.
        Another consequence of unequal-size segments is that there is no simple rela-
     tionship between logical addresses and physical addresses. Analogous to paging, a
     simple segmentation scheme would make use of a segment table for each process
     and a list of free blocks of main memory. Each segment table entry would have
     to give the starting address in main memory of the corresponding segment. The
     entry should also provide the length of the segment, to assure that invalid addresses
     are not used. When a process enters the Running state, the address of its segment
     table is loaded into a special register used by the memory management hardware.
     Consider an address of n  m bits, where the leftmost n bits are the segment number
     and the rightmost m bits are the offset. In our example (Figure 7.11c), n  4 and
     m  12. Thus the maximum segment size is 212  4096. The following steps are
     needed for address translation:
     ·  Extract the segment number as the leftmost n bits of the logical address.
     ·  Use the segment number as an index into the process segment table to find the
        starting physical address of the segment.
     ·  Compare the offset, expressed in the rightmost m bits, to the length of the seg-
        ment. If the offset is greater than or equal to the length, the address is invalid.
