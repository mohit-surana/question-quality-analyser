         Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend
         which Dr. Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours
         of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
           Understand the concept of thread granularity.
           Discuss the key design issues in multiprocessor thread scheduling and some
            of the key approaches to scheduling.
           Understand the requirements imposed by real-time scheduling.
           Explain the scheduling methods used in Linux, UNIX SVR4, and Windows 7.
      This chapter continues our survey of process and thread scheduling. We begin with
      an examination of issues raised by the availability of more than one processor. A
      number of design issues are explored. This is followed by a look at the scheduling of
      processes on a multiprocessor system. Then the somewhat different design consid-
      erations for multiprocessor thread scheduling are examined. The second section of
      this chapter covers real-time scheduling. The section begins with a discussion of the
      characteristics of real-time processes and then looks at the nature of the schedul-
      ing process. Two approaches to real-time scheduling, deadline scheduling and rate
      monotonic scheduling, are examined.
