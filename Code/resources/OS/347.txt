Segmentation

     A user program can be subdivided using segmentation, in which the program and its
     associated data are divided into a number of segments. It is not required that all seg-
     ments of all programs be of the same length, although there is a maximum segment
     length. As with paging, a logical address using segmentation consists of two parts, in
     this case a segment number and an offset.
        Because of the use of unequal-size segments, segmentation is similar to
     dynamic partitioning. In the absence of an overlay scheme or the use of virtual
     memory, it would be required that all of a program's segments be loaded into mem-
     ory for execution. The difference, compared to dynamic partitioning, is that with
     segmentation a program may occupy more than one partition, and these partitions
     need not be contiguous. Segmentation eliminates internal fragmentation but, like
     dynamic partitioning, it suffers from external fragmentation. However, because a
     process is broken up into a number of smaller pieces, the external fragmentation
     should be less.
        Whereas paging is invisible to the programmer, segmentation is usually visible
     and is provided as a convenience for organizing programs and data. Typically, the
     programmer or compiler will assign programs and data to different segments. For
     purposes of modular programming, the program or data may be further broken
     down into multiple segments. The principal inconvenience of this service is that the
     programmer must be aware of the maximum segment size limitation.
        Another consequence of unequal-size segments is that there is no simple rela-
     tionship between logical addresses and physical addresses. Analogous to paging, a
     simple segmentation scheme would make use of a segment table for each process
     and a list of free blocks of main memory. Each segment table entry would have
     to give the starting address in main memory of the corresponding segment. The
     entry should also provide the length of the segment, to assure that invalid addresses
     are not used. When a process enters the Running state, the address of its segment
     table is loaded into a special register used by the memory management hardware.
     Consider an address of n  m bits, where the leftmost n bits are the segment number
     and the rightmost m bits are the offset. In our example (Figure 7.11c), n  4 and
     m  12. Thus the maximum segment size is 212  4096. The following steps are
     needed for address translation:
       Extract the segment number as the leftmost n bits of the logical address.
       Use the segment number as an index into the process segment table to find the
        starting physical address of the segment.
       Compare the offset, expressed in the rightmost m bits, to the length of the seg-
        ment. If the offset is greater than or equal to the length, the address is invalid.

      The desired physical address is the sum of the starting physical address of the
     segment plus the offset.
     In our example, we have the logical address 0001001011110000, which is
     segment number 1, offset 752. Suppose that this segment is residing in main mem-
     ory starting at physical address 0010000000100000. Then the physical address is
     0010000000100000 + 001011110000  0010001100010000 (Figure 7.12b).
     To summarize, with simple segmentation, a process is divided into a number
     of segments that need not be of equal size. When a process is brought in, all of its
     segments are loaded into available regions of memory, and a segment table is set up.
