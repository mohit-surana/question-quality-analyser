         To guard against the baneful influence exerted by strangers is therefore
         an elementary dictate of savage prudence. Hence before strangers are
         allowed to enter a district, or at least before they are permitted to mingle
         freely with the inhabitants, certain ceremonies are often performed by
         the natives of the country for the purpose of disarming the strangers
         of their magical powers, or of disinfecting, so to speak, the tainted
         atmosphere by which they are supposed to be surrounded.
                                     --THE GOLDEN BOUGH, Sir James George Frazer
