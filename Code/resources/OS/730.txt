     to participate in a number of global namespaces. The following are examples of
     Beowulf system software:
       Beowulf distributed process space (BPROC): This package allows a process
        ID space to span multiple nodes in a cluster environment and also provides
        mechanisms for starting processes on other nodes. The goal of this package is
        to provide key elements needed for a single system image on Beowulf cluster.
        BPROC provides a mechanism to start processes on remote nodes without
        ever logging into another node and by making all the remote processes visible
        in the process table of the cluster's front-end node.
       Beowulf Ethernet channel bonding: This is a mechanism that joins multiple
        low-cost networks into a single logical network with higher bandwidth. The
        only additional work over using single network interface is the computation-
        ally simple task of distributing the packets over the available device trans-
        mit queues. This approach allows load balancing over multiple Ethernets
        connected to Linux workstations.
       Pvmsync: This is a programming environment that provides synchronization
        mechanisms and shared data objects for processes in a Beowulf cluster.
       EnFuzion: EnFuzion consists of a set of tools for doing parametric computing,
        as described in Section 16.4. Parametric computing involves the execution of
        a program as a large number of jobs, each with different parameters or start-
        ing conditions. EnFusion emulates a set of robot users on a single root node
        machine, each of which will log into one of the many clients that form a clus-
        ter. Each job is set up to run with a unique, programmed scenario, with an
        appropriate set of starting conditions [KAPP00].
16.8 SUMMARY
     Client/server computing is the key to realizing the potential of information systems
     and networks to improve productivity significantly in organizations. With client/
     server computing, applications are distributed to users on single-user workstations
     and personal computers. At the same time, resources that can and should be shared
     are maintained on server systems that are available to all clients. Thus, the client/
     server architecture is a blend of decentralized and centralized computing.
        Typically, the client system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that
     enables a user to exploit a variety of applications with minimal training and relative
     ease. Servers support shared utilities, such as database management systems. The
     actual application is divided between client and server in a way intended to optimize
     ease of use and performance.
        The key mechanism required in any distributed system is interprocess com-
     munication. Two techniques are in common use. A message-passing facility gener-
     alizes the use of messages within a single system. The same sorts of conventions and
     synchronization rules apply. Another approach is the use of the remote procedure
     call. This is a technique by which two programs on different machines interact using
     procedure call/return syntax and semantics. Both the called and calling program
     behave as if the partner program were running on the same machine.

      A cluster is a group of interconnected, whole computers working together as
      a unified computing resource that can create the illusion of being one machine. The
      term whole computer means a system that can run on its own, apart from the cluster.
16.9  RECOMMENDED READING AND WEB SITES
      [BERS96] provides a good technical discussion of the design issues involved in allo-
      cating applications to client and server and in middleware approaches; the book
      also discusses products and standardization efforts. [REAG00a] and [REAG00b]
      cover client/server computing and network design approaches for supporting client/
      server computing.
      A good overview of middleware technology and products is [BRIT04].
      [MENA05] provides a performance comparison of remote procedure calls and
      distributed message passing.
      Two worthwhile surveys of SOA are [BROW03] and [BIH06]. [CHER05] and
      [BIEB05] analyze the impact of migrating to a SOA. [HUTC08] discusses strategies
      for migrating to an SOA. [CARE08] looks at the role of data services in an SOA.
      [TANE85] is a survey of distributed operating systems that covers both dis-
      tributed process communication and distributed process management. [CHAN90]
      provides an overview of distributed message passing operating systems. [TAY90]
      is a survey of the approach taken by various operating systems in implementing
      remote procedure calls.
      A thorough treatment of clusters can be found in [BUYY99a] and [BUYY99b].
      The former has a good treatment of Beowulf, which is also nicely covered in
      [RIDG97]. A more detailed treatment of Beowulf is [STER99].Windows Cluster
      Server is described in [SHOR97]; [RAJA00] provides a more detailed treatment.
      [LAI06] provides a close examination of thin client architecture.
