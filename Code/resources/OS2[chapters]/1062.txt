                                  13
READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
In the previous 12 chapters we have touched upon a variety of topics. This
chapter is intended to aid  readers interested in pursuing their study of operating
systems further. Section 13.1 is a list of suggested readings.      Section 13.2 is an
alphabetical bibliography of all books and articles cited in this book.
In addition to the references given below, the ACM Symposium on Operating
Systems Principles (SOSP) held in odd-numbered years and the USENIX Sympo-
sium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) held in even num-
bered years are good sources for ongoing work on operating systems. The Eurosys
Conference, held annually is also a source of top-flight papers.         Furthermore, the
journals ACM Transactions on Computer Systems and ACM SIGOPS Operating
Systems  Review,  often     have  relevant  articles.  Many  other  ACM,  IEEE,       and
USENIX conferences deal with specialized topics.
13.1 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING
In this section, we give some suggestions for further reading. Unlike the papers
cited in the sections entitled ``RESEARCH ON ...'' in the text, which are about cur-
rent research, these references are mostly introductory or tutorial in nature. They
can, however, serve to present material in this book from a different perspective or
with a different emphasis.

1032                   READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY                      CHAP. 13
13.1.1  Introduction
Silberschatz et al., Operating System Concepts, 9th ed.,
     A general textbook on operating systems.      It covers processes, memory man-
agement, storage management, protection and security, distributed systems, and
some special-purpose systems. Two case studies are given: Linux and Windows 7.
The cover is full of dinosaurs.  These are legacy animals, to empahsize that operat-
ing systems also carry a lot of legacy.
Stallings, Operating Systems, 7th ed.,
     Still another textbook on operating systems.  It covers all the traditional topics,
and also includes a small amount of material on distributed systems.
Stevens and Rago, Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
     This book tells how to write C programs that use the UNIX system call inter-
face and the standard C library. Examples are based on the System V Release 4 and
the  4.4BSD  versions  of  UNIX.  The    relationship     of  these  implementations      to
POSIX is described in detail.
Tanenbaum and Woodhull, Operating Systems Design and Implementation
     A hands-on way to learn about operating systems.         This book discusses the
usual principles, but in addition discusses an actual operating system, MINIX 3, in
great detail, and contains a listing of that system as an appendix.
13.1.2 Processes and Threads
Arpaci-Dusseau and Arpaci-Dusseau, Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
     The entire first part of this book is dedicated to virtualization of the CPU to
share it with multiple processes. What is nice about this book (besides the fact that
there is a free online version), is that it introduces not only the concepts of process-
ing and scheduling techniques, but also the APIs and systems calls like fork and
exec in some detail.
Andrews and Schneider, ``Concepts and Notations for Concurrent Programming''
     A tutorial and survey of processes and interprocess communication, including
busy waiting, semaphores, monitors, message passing, and other techniques.                The
article also shows how these concepts are embedded in various programming lan-
guages. The article is old, but it has stood the test of time very well.
Ben-Ari, Principles of Concurrent Programming
     This little book is entirely devoted to the problems of interprocess communica-
tion. There are chapters on mutual exclusion, semaphores, monitors, and the dining
philosophers problem, among others. It, too, has stood up very well over the years.



SEC. 13.1               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING                             1033
Zhuravlev  et  al.,  ``Survey   of  Scheduling   Techniques     for  Addressing     Shared
Resources in Multicore Processors''
Multicore systems have started to dominate the field of general-purpose com-
puting world. One of the most important challenges is shared resource contention.
In this survey, the authors present different scheduling techniques for handling
such contention.
Silberschatz et al., Operating System Concepts, 9th ed.,
Chapters 3 through 6 cover processes and interprocess communication, includ-
ing scheduling, critical sections, semaphores, monitors, and classical interprocess
communication problems.
Stratton et al., ``Algorithm and Data Optimization Techniques for Scaling to Mas-
sively Threaded Systems''
Programming a system with half a dozen threads is hard enough.                But what
happens when you have thousands of them? To say it gets tricky is to put it mildly.
This article talks about approaches that are being taken.
13.1.3 Memory Management
Denning, ``Virtual Memory''
A classic paper on many aspects of virtual memory. Peter Denning was one of
the pioneers in this field, and was the inventor of the working-set concept.
Denning, ``Working Sets Past and Present''
A good overview of numerous memory management and paging algorithms.
A comprehensive bibliography is included. Although many of the papers are old,
the principles really have not changed at all.
Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 1
First fit, best fit, and other memory management algorithms are discussed and
compared in this book.
Arpaci-Dusseau and Arpaci-Dusseaum ``Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces''
This book has a rich section on virtual memory in Chapters 12 to 23 and
includes a nice overview of page replacement policies.
13.1.4 File Systems
McKusick et al., ``A Fast File System for UNIX''
The  UNIX         file  system  was  completely   redone   for  4.2  BSD.     This  paper
describes the design of the new file system, with emphasis on its performance.



1034                   READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY                   CHAP. 13
Silberschatz et al., Operating System Concepts, 9th ed.,
Chapters 10­12 are about storage hardware and file systems.      They cover file
operations, interfaces, access methods, directories, and implementation, among
other topics.
Stallings, Operating Systems, 7th ed.,
Chapter 12 contains a fair amount of material about file systems and little bit
about their security.
Cornwell, ``Anatomy of a Solid-state Drive``
If you are interested in solid state drives, Michael Cornwell's introduction is a
good starting point. In particular, the author succinctly describes the way in way
traditional hard drives and SSDs differ.
13.1.5 Input/Output
Geist and Daniel, ``A Continuum of Disk Scheduling Algorithms''
A generalized disk-arm scheduling algorithm is presented. Extensive simula-
tion and experimental results are given.
Scheible, ``A Survey of Storage Options''
There are many ways to store bits these days: DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, flash
memory, hard disk, floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, and tape, to name a few.  In this
article, the various technologies are surveyed and their strengths and weaknesses
highlighted.
Stan and Skadron, ``Power-Aware Computing''
Until someone manages to get Moore's Law to apply to batteries, energy usage
is going to continue to be a major issue in mobile devices.  Power and heat are so
critical these days that operating systems are aware of the CPU temperature and
adapt their behavior to it.  This article surveys some of the issues and serves as an
introduction to five other articles in this special issue of Computer on power-aware
computing.
Swanson and Caulfield, ``Refactor, Reduce, Recycle: Restructuring the I/O Stack
for the Future of Storage''
Disks exist for two reasons: when power is turned off, RAM loses its contents.
Also, disks are very big.    But suppose RAM did not lose its contents when pow-
ered off? How would that change the I/O stack?  Nonvolatile memory is here and
this article looks at how it changes systems.
Ion, ``From Touch Displays to the Surface: A Brief History of Touchscreen Tech-
nology,''



SEC. 13.1            SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING                  1035
Touch screens have become ubiquitous in a short time span. This article traces
the history of the touch screen through history with easy-to-understand explana-
tions and nice vintage pictures and videos. Fascinating stuff!
Walker and Cragon, ``Interrupt Processing in Concurrent Processors''
Implementing precise interrupts on superscalar computers is a challenging
activity. The trick is to serialize the state and do it quickly. A number of the design
issues and trade-offs are discussed here.
13.1.6 Deadlocks
Coffman et al., ``System Deadlocks''
A short introduction to deadlocks, what causes them, and how they can be pre-
vented or detected.
Holt, ``Some Deadlock Properties of Computer Systems''
A discussion of deadlocks. Holt introduces a directed graph model that can be
used to analyze some deadlock situations.
Isloor and Marsland, ``The Deadlock Problem: An Overview''
A tutorial on deadlocks, with special emphasis on database systems.   A variety
of models and algorithms are covered.
Levine, ``Defining Deadlock''
In Chap. 6 of this book, we focused on resource deadlocks and barely touched
on other kinds.  This short paper points out that in the literature, various definitions
have been used, differing in subtle ways. The author then looks at communication,
scheduling, and interleaved deadlocks and comes up with a new model that tries to
cover all of them.
Shub, ``A Unified Treatment of Deadlock''
This short tutorial summarizes the causes and solutions to deadlocks and sug-
gests what to emphasize when teaching it to students.
13.1.7 Virtualization and the Cloud
Portnoy, ``Virtualization Essentials''
A gentle introduction to virtualization. It covers the context (including the rela-
tion between virtualization and the cloud), and covers a variety of solutions (with a
bit more emphasis on VMware).
Erl et al., Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture
A book devoted to cloud computing in a broad sense. The authors explain in



1036                  READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY                     CHAP. 13
detail what is hidden behind acronyms like IAAS, PAAS, SAAS, and similar ``X''
As A Service family members.
Rosenblum and Garfinkel, ``Virtual Machine Monitors: Current Technology and
Future Trends''
Starting with a history of virtual machine monitors, this article then goes on to
discuss the current state of CPU, memory, and I/O virtualization. In particular, it
covers problem areas relating to all three and how future hardware may alleviate
the problems.
Whitaker et al., ``Rethinking the Design of Virtual Machine Monitors''
Most computers have some bizarre and difficult to virtualize aspects.            In this
paper, the authors of the Denali system argue for paravirtualization, that is, chang-
ing the guest operating systems to avoid using the bizarre features so that they need
not be emulated.
13.1.8 Multiple Processor Systems
Ahmad, ``Gigantic Clusters: Where Are They and What Are They Doing?''
To get an idea of the state-of-the-art in large multicomputers, this is a good
place to look.   It describes the idea and gives an overview of some of the larger
systems currently in operation. Given the working of Moore's law, it is a reason-
able bet that the sizes mentioned here will double about every two years or so.
Dubois et al., ``Synchronization, Coherence, and Event Ordering in Multiproces-
sors''
A tutorial on synchronization in shared-memory multiprocessor systems. How-
ever, some of the ideas are equally applicable to single-processor and distributed
memory systems as well.
Geer, ``For Programmers, Multicore Chips Mean Multiple Challenges''
Multicore chips are happening--whether the software folks are ready or not.
As it turns out, they are not ready, and programming these chips offers many chal-
lenges, from getting the right tools, to dividing up the work into little pieces, to
testing the results.
Kant and Mohapatra, ``Internet Data Centers''
Internet data centers are massive multicomputers on steroids.           They often con-
tain tens or hundreds of thousands of computers working on a single application.
Scalability, maintenance, and energy use are major issues here.  This article forms
an introduction to the subject and introduces four additional articles on the subject.



SEC. 13.1              SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING                         1037
Kumar et al., ``Heterogeneous Chip Multiprocessors''
     The multicore chips used for desktop computers are symmetric--all the cores
are  identical.  However,        for  some  applications,  heterogeneous       CMPs      are
widespread, with cores for computing, video decoding, audio decoding, and so on.
This paper discusses some issues related to heterogeneous CMPs.
Kwok and Ahmad, ``Static Scheduling Algorithms for Allocating Directed Task
Graphs to Multiprocessors''
     Optimal job scheduling of a multicomputer or multiprocessor is possible when
the characteristics of all the jobs are known in advance. The problem is that opti-
mal scheduling takes too long to compute.         In this paper, the authors discuss and
compare 27 known algorithms for attacking this problem in different ways.
Zhuravlev  et    al.,  ``Survey  of   Scheduling  Techniques  for  Addressing  Shared
Resources in Multicore Processors''
     As mentioned earlier, one of the most important challenges in multiprocessor
systems is shared resource contention. This survey presents different scheduling
techniques for handling such contention.
13.1.9 Security
Anderson, Security Engineering, 2nd Edition
     A wonderful book that explains very clearly how to build dependable and
secure systems by one of the best-known researchers in the field. Not only is this a
fascinating look at many aspects of security (including techniques, applications,
and organizational issues), it is also freely available online. No excuse for not read-
ing it.
Van der Veen et al., ``Memory Errors: the Past, the Present, and the Future''
     A historical view on memory errors (including buffer overflows, format string
attacks, dangling pointers, and many others) that includes attacks and defenses,
attacks that evade those defenses, new defenses that stop the attacks that evaded the
earlier defenses, and ..., well, anyway, you get the idea. The authors show that
despite their old age and the rise of other types of attack, memory errors remain an
extremely important attack vector. Moreover, they argue that this situation is not
likely to change any time soon.
Bratus, ``What Hackers Learn That the Rest of Us Don't''
     What makes hackers different?    What do they care about that regular program-
mers do not?     Do they have different attitudes toward APIs?     Are corner cases
important? Curious? Read it.



1038                   READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY                     CHAP. 13
Bratus et al., ``From Buffer Overflows to Weird Machines and Theory of Computa-
tion''
Connecting the humble buffer overflow to Alan Turing. The authors show that
hackers program vulnerable programs like weird machines with strange-looking
instruction sets. In doing so, they come full circle to Turing's seminal research on
``What is computable?''
Denning, Information Warfare and Security
Information has become a weapon of war, both military and corporate. The
participants try not only to attack the other side's information systems, but to safe-
guard their own, too.  In this fascinating book, the author covers every conceivable
topic relating to offensive and defensive strategy, from data diddling to packet snif-
fers. A must read for anyone seriously interested in computer security.
Ford and Allen, ``How Not to Be Seen''
Viruses, spyware, rootkits, and digital rights management systems all have a
great interest in hiding things. This article provides a brief introduction to stealth in
its various forms.
Hafner and Markoff, Cyberpunk
Three compelling tales of young hackers breaking into computers around the
world are told here by the New York Times computer reporter who broke the Inter-
net worm story (Markoff).
Johnson and Jajodia, ``Exploring Steganography: Seeing the Unseen''
Steganography has a long history, going back to the days when the writer
would shave the head of a messenger, tattoo a message on the shaved head, and
send him off after the hair grew back. Although current techniques are often hairy,
they are also digital and have lower latency.  For a thorough introduction to the
subject as currently practiced, this paper is the place to start.
Ludwig, ``The Little Black Book of Email Viruses''
If you want to write antivirus software and need to understand how viruses
work down to the bit level, this is the book for you. Every kind of virus is dis-
cussed at length and actual code for many of them is supplied as well. A thorough
knowledge of programming the x86 in assembly language is a must, however.
Mead, ``Who is Liable for Insecure Systems?''
Although most work on computer security approaches it from a technical per-
spective, that is not the only one.  Suppose software vendors were legally liable for
the damages caused by their faulty software. Chances are security would get a lot
more attention from vendors than it does now? Intrigued by this idea? Read this
article.



SEC. 13.1  SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING                              1039
Milojicic, ``Security and Privacy''
Security has many facets, including operating systems, networks, implications
for privacy, and more.    In this article, six security experts are interviewed on their
thoughts on the subject.
Nachenberg, ``Computer Virus-Antivirus Coevolution''
As soon as the antivirus developers find a way to detect and neutralize some
class of computer virus, the virus writers go them one better and improve the virus.
The cat-and-mouse game played by the virus and antivirus sides is discussed here.
The author is not optimistic about the antivirus writers winning the war, which is
bad news for computer users.
Sasse, ``Red-Eye Blink, Bendy Shuffle, and the Yuck Factor: A User Experience of
Biometric Airport Systems''
The author discusses his experiences with the iris recognition system used at a
number of large airports. Not all of them are positive.
Thibadeau, ``Trusted Computing for Disk Drives and Other Peripherals''
If you thought a disk drive was just a place where bits are stored, think again.
A modern disk drive has a powerful CPU, megabytes of RAM, multiple communi-
cation channels, and even its own boot ROM.       In short, it is a complete computer
system ripe for attack and in need of its own protection system. This paper dis-
cusses securing the disk drive.
13.1.10 Case Study 1: UNIX, Linux, and Android
Bovet and Cesati, Understanding the Linux Kernel
This book is probably the best overall discussion of the Linux kernel.  It covers
processes, memory management, file systems, signals, and much more.
IEEE, ``Information Technology--Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX),
Part 1: System Application Program Interface (API) [C Language]''
This is the standard. Some parts are actually quite readable, especially Annex
B, ``Rationale and Notes,'' which often sheds light on why things are done as they
are. One advantage of referring to the standards document is that, by definition,
there are no errors. If a typographical error in a macro name makes it through the
editing process it is no longer an error, it is official.
Fusco, The Linux Programmer's Toolbox
This book describes how to use Linux for the intermediate user, one who
knows the basics and wants to start exploring how the many Linux programs work.
It is intended for C programmers.

Maxwell, Linux Core Kernel Commentary
The first 400 pages of this book contain a subset of the Linux kernel code. The
last 150 pages consist of comments on the code, very much in the style of John
Lions' classic book.  If you want to understand the Linux kernel in all its gory
detail, this is the place to begin, but be warned: reading 40,000 lines of C is not for
everyone.
13.1.11 Case Study 2: Windows 8
Cusumano and Selby, ``How Microsoft Builds Software''
Have you ever wondered how anyone could write a 29-million-line program
(like Windows 2000) and have it work at all?  To find out how Microsoft's build-
and-test cycle is used to manage very large software projects, take a look at this
paper. The procedure is quite instructive.
Rector and Newcomer, Win32 Programming
If you are looking for one of those 1500-page books giving a summary of how
to write Windows programs, this is not a bad start.       It covers windows, devices,
graphical  output,    keyboard  and  mouse  input,  printing,  memory  management,
libraries, and synchronization, among many other topics. It requires knowledge of
C or C++.
Russinovich and Solomon, Windows Internals, Part 1
If you want to learn how to use Windows, there are hundreds of books out
there.  If you want to know how Windows works inside, this is your best bet.             It
covers numerous internal algorithms and data structures, and in considerable tech-
nical detail. No other book comes close.
13.1.12 Operating System Design
Saltzer and Kaashoek, Principles of Computer System Design: An Introduction
This books looks at computer systems in general, rather than operating systems
per se, but the principles they identify apply very much to operating systems also.
What is interesting about this work is that it carefully identifies ``the ideas that
worked,'' such as names, file systems, read-write coherence, authenticated and
confidential messages, etc. Principles that, in our opinion, all computer scientists in
the world should recite every day, before going to work.
Brooks, The Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering
Fred Brooks was one of the designers of IBM's OS/360.          He learned the hard
way what works and what does not work. The advice given in this witty, amusing,
and informative book is as valid now as it was a quarter of a century ago when he
first wrote it down.



SEC. 13.1             SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING                       1041
Cooke et al., ``UNIX and Beyond: An Interview with Ken Thompson''
Designing an operating system is much more of an art than a science. Conse-
quently, listening to experts in the field is a good way to learn about the subject.
They do not come much more expert than Ken Thompson, co-designer of UNIX,
Inferno, and Plan 9.  In this wide-ranging interview, Thompson gives his thoughts
on where we came from and where we are going in the field.
Corbato´, ``On Building Systems That Will Fail''
In his Turing Award lecture, the father of timesharing addresses many of the
same concerns that Brooks does in The Mythical Man-Month.    His conclusion is
that all complex systems will ultimately fail, and that to have any chance for suc-
cess at all, it is absolutely essential to avoid complexity and strive for simplicity
and elegance in design.
Crowley, Operating Systems: A Design-Oriented Approach
Most textbooks on operating systems just describe the basic concepts (pro-
cesses, virtual memory, etc.) and give a few examples, but say nothing about how
to design an operating system. This one is unique in devoting four chapters to the
subject.
Lampson, ``Hints for Computer System Design''
Butler Lampson, one of the world's leading designers of innovative operating
systems, has collected many hints, suggestions, and guidelines from his years of
experience and put them together in this entertaining and informative article. Like
Brooks' book, this is required reading for every aspiring operating system designer.
Wirth, ``A Plea for Lean Software''
Niklaus Wirth, a famous and experienced system designer, makes the case here
for lean and mean software based on a few simple concepts, instead of the bloated
mess that much commercial software is.    He makes his point by discussing his
Oberon system, a network-oriented, GUI-based operating system that fits in 200
KB, including the Oberon compiler and text editor.

Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, 3rd ed.
All other textbooks on operating systems are long on theory and short on practice. This one is
different. In addition to the usual material on processes, memory management, file systems, I/O, and
so on, it contains a CD-ROM with the source code (in C) of a small, but complete, POSIX-confor-
mant operating system called MINIX 3 (see www.minix3.org). All the principles are illustrated by
showing how they apply to MINIX 3. The reader can also compile, test, and experiment with MINIX
3, leading to in-depth knowledge of how an operating system really works.

Computer Networks, 5th ed.
This widely read classic, with a fifth edition co-authored with David Wetherall, provides the
ideal introduction to today's and tomorrow's networks. It explains in detail how modern networks are
structured. Starting with the physical layer and working up to the application layer, the book covers a
vast number of important topics, including wireless communication, fiber optics, data link protocols,
Ethernet, routing algorithms, network performance, security, DNS, electronic mail, the World Wide
Web, and multimedia. The book has especially thorough coverage of TCP/IP and the Internet.

Structured Computer Organization, 6th ed.
Computers are getting more complicated every year but this best-selling book makes computer
architecture and organization easy to understand. It starts at the very beginning explaining how a tran-
sistor works and from there explains the basic circuits from which computers are built. Then it moves
up the design stack to cover the microarchitecture, and the assembly language level. The final chapter
is about parallel computer architectures. No hardware background is needed to understand any part
of this book.

Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, 2nd ed.
Distributed systems are becoming ever-more important in the world and this book explains their
principles and illustrates them with numerous examples. Among the topics covered are architectures,
processes, communication, naming, synchronization, consistency, fault tolerance, and security. Exam-
ples are taken from distributed object-based, file, Web-based, and coordination-based systems.
