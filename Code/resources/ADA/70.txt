Mathematical Analysis of Recursive Algorithms
In this section, we will see how to apply the general framework for analysis
         of algorithms to recursive algorithms. We start with an example often used to
         introduce novices to the idea of a recursive algorithm.
         EXAMPLE 1  Compute the factorial function F (n) = n! for an arbitrary nonneg-
         ative integer n. Since
                    n! = 1 . . . . . (n - 1) . n = (n - 1)! . n   for n  1
         and 0! = 1 by definition, we can compute F (n) = F (n - 1) . n with the following
         recursive algorithm.
         ALGORITHM  F(n)
              //Computes n! recursively
              //Input: A nonnegative integer n
              //Output: The value of n!
              if n = 0 return 1
              else return F (n - 1)  n
              For simplicity, we consider n itself as an indicator of this algorithm's input size
         (rather than the number of bits in its binary expansion). The basic operation of the
         algorithm is multiplication,5 whose number of executions we denote M(n). Since
         the function F (n) is computed according to the formula
                                 F (n) = F (n - 1) . n  for n > 0,
    5.   Alternatively, we could count the number of times the comparison n = 0 is executed, which is the same
         as counting the total number of calls made by the algorithm (see Problem 2 in this section's exercises).
the number of multiplications M(n) needed to compute it must satisfy the equality
                 M(n) = M(n - 1)       +       1        for n > 0.
                           to compute     to multiply
                           F (n-1)        F (n-1) by n
Indeed, M(n - 1) multiplications are spent to compute F (n - 1), and one more
multiplication is needed to multiply the result by n.
The last equation defines the sequence M(n) that we need to find. This equa-
tion defines M(n) not explicitly, i.e., as a function of n, but implicitly as a function
of its value at another point, namely n - 1. Such equations are called recurrence
relations or, for brevity, recurrences. Recurrence relations play an important role
not only in analysis of algorithms but also in some areas of applied mathematics.
They are usually studied in detail in courses on discrete mathematics or discrete
structures; a very brief tutorial on them is provided in Appendix B. Our goal now
is to solve the recurrence relation M(n) = M(n - 1) + 1, i.e., to find an explicit
formula for M(n) in terms of n only.
Note, however, that there is not one but infinitely many sequences that satisfy
this recurrence. (Can you give examples of, say, two of them?) To determine a
solution uniquely, we need an initial condition that tells us the value with which
the sequence starts. We can obtain this value by inspecting the condition that
makes the algorithm stop its recursive calls:
                             if n = 0 return 1.
This tells us two things. First, since the calls stop when n = 0, the smallest value
of n for which this algorithm is executed and hence M(n) defined is 0. Second, by
inspecting the pseudocode's exiting line, we can see that when n = 0, the algorithm
performs no multiplications. Therefore, the initial condition we are after is
                             M(0) = 0.
the calls stop when n = 0                               no multiplications when n = 0
Thus, we succeeded in setting up the recurrence relation and initial condition
for the algorithm's number of multiplications M(n):
                 M(n) = M(n - 1) + 1              for n > 0,                           (2.2)
                 M(0) = 0.
Before we embark on a discussion of how to solve this recurrence, let us
pause to reiterate an important point. We are dealing here with two recursively
defined functions. The first is the factorial function F (n) itself; it is defined by the
recurrence
                 F (n) = F (n - 1) . n         for every n > 0,
                 F (0) = 1.
The second is the number of multiplications M(n) needed to compute F (n) by the
recursive algorithm whose pseudocode was given at the beginning of the section.
    As we just showed, M(n) is defined by recurrence (2.2). And it is recurrence (2.2)
    that we need to solve now.
        Though it is not difficult to "guess" the solution here (what sequence starts
    with 0 when n = 0 and increases by 1 on each step?), it will be more useful to
    arrive at it in a systematic fashion. From the several techniques available for
    solving recurrence relations, we use what can be called the method of backward
    substitutions. The method's idea (and the reason for the name) is immediately
    clear from the way it applies to solving our particular recurrence:
        M(n) = M(n - 1) + 1                        substitute M(n - 1) = M(n - 2) + 1
        = [M(n - 2) + 1] + 1 = M(n - 2) + 2        substitute M(n - 2) = M(n - 3) + 1
        = [M(n - 3) + 1] + 2 = M(n - 3) + 3.
    After inspecting the first three lines, we see an emerging pattern, which makes it
    possible to predict not only the next line (what would it be?) but also a general
    formula for the pattern: M(n) = M(n - i) + i. Strictly speaking, the correctness of
    this formula should be proved by mathematical induction, but it is easier to get to
    the solution as follows and then verify its correctness.
        What remains to be done is to take advantage of the initial condition given.
    Since it is specified for n = 0, we have to substitute i = n in the pattern's formula
    to get the ultimate result of our backward substitutions:
        M(n) = M(n - 1) + 1 = . . . = M(n - i) + i = . . . = M(n - n) + n = n.
        You should not be disappointed after exerting so much effort to get this
    "obvious" answer. The benefits of the method illustrated in this simple example
    will become clear very soon, when we have to solve more difficult recurrences.
    Also, note that the simple iterative algorithm that accumulates the product of n
    consecutive integers requires the same number of multiplications, and it does so
    without the overhead of time and space used for maintaining the recursion's stack.
        The issue of time efficiency is actually not that important for the problem of
    computing n!, however. As we saw in Section 2.1, the function's values get so large
    so fast that we can realistically compute exact values of n! only for very small n's.
    Again, we use this example just as a simple and convenient vehicle to introduce
    the standard approach to analyzing recursive algorithms.
        Generalizing our experience with investigating the recursive algorithm for
    computing n!, we can now outline a general plan for investigating recursive algo-
    rithms.
    General Plan for Analyzing the Time Efficiency of Recursive Algorithms
    1.  Decide on a parameter (or parameters) indicating an input's size.
    2.  Identify the algorithm's basic operation.
3.  Check whether the number of times the basic operation is executed can vary
    on different inputs of the same size; if it can, the worst-case, average-case, and
    best-case efficiencies must be investigated separately.
4.  Set up a recurrence relation, with an appropriate initial condition, for the
    number of times the basic operation is executed.
5.  Solve the recurrence or, at least, ascertain the order of growth of its solution.
EXAMPLE 2     As our next example, we consider another educational workhorse
of recursive algorithms: the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. In this puzzle, we (or mythical
monks, if you do not like to move disks) have n disks of different sizes that can
slide onto any of three pegs. Initially, all the disks are on the first peg in order of
size, the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top. The goal is to move all the
disks to the third peg, using the second one as an auxiliary, if necessary. We can
move only one disk at a time, and it is forbidden to place a larger disk on top of a
smaller one.
    The problem has an elegant recursive solution, which is illustrated in Fig-
ure 2.4. To move n > 1 disks from peg 1 to peg 3 (with peg 2 as auxiliary), we first
move recursively n - 1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (with peg 3 as auxiliary), then
move the largest disk directly from peg 1 to peg 3, and, finally, move recursively
n - 1 disks from peg 2 to peg 3 (using peg 1 as auxiliary). Of course, if n = 1, we
simply move the single disk directly from the source peg to the destination peg.

FIGURE  2.4   Recursive  solution to  the  Tower  of  Hanoi puzzle.
    Let us apply the general plan outlined above to the Tower of Hanoi problem.
    The number of disks n is the obvious choice for the input's size indicator, and so is
    moving one disk as the algorithm's basic operation. Clearly, the number of moves
    M(n) depends on n only, and we get the following recurrence equation for it:
                 M(n) = M(n - 1) + 1 + M(n - 1)           for n > 1.
    With the obvious initial condition M(1) = 1, we have the following recurrence
    relation for the number of moves M(n):
                          M(n) = 2M(n - 1) + 1            for n > 1,              (2.3)
                          M(1) = 1.
    We solve this recurrence by the same method of backward substitutions:
    M(n) = 2M(n - 1) + 1                                  sub. M(n - 1) = 2M(n - 2) + 1
    = 2[2M(n - 2) + 1] + 1 = 22M(n - 2) + 2 + 1           sub. M(n - 2) = 2M(n - 3) + 1
    = 22[2M(n - 3) + 1] + 2 + 1 = 23M(n - 3) + 22 + 2 + 1.
    The pattern of the first three sums on the left suggests that the next one will be
    24M(n - 4) + 23 + 22 + 2 + 1, and generally, after i substitutions, we get
    M(n) = 2iM(n - i) + 2i-1 + 2i-2 + . . . + 2 + 1 = 2iM(n - i) + 2i - 1.
    Since the initial condition is specified for n = 1, which is achieved for i = n - 1, we
    get the following formula for the solution to recurrence (2.3):
    M(n) = 2n-1M(n - (n - 1)) + 2n-1 - 1
                 = 2n-1M(1) + 2n-1 - 1 = 2n-1 + 2n-1 - 1 = 2n - 1.
    Thus, we have an exponential algorithm, which will run for an unimaginably
    long time even for moderate values of n (see Problem 5 in this section's exercises).
    This is not due to the fact that this particular algorithm is poor; in fact, it is not
    difficult to prove that this is the most efficient algorithm possible for this problem.
    It is the problem's intrinsic difficulty that makes it so computationally hard. Still,
    this example makes an important general point:
    One should be careful with recursive algorithms because their succinctness
    may mask their inefficiency.
    When a recursive algorithm makes more than a single call to itself, it can be
    useful for analysis purposes to construct a tree of its recursive calls. In this tree,
    nodes correspond to recursive calls, and we can label them with the value of the
    parameter (or, more generally, parameters) of the calls. For the Tower of Hanoi
    example, the tree is given in Figure 2.5. By counting the number of nodes in the
    tree, we can get the total number of calls made by the Tower of Hanoi algorithm:
            n-1
    C(n) =       2l (where l is the level in the tree in Figure 2.5) = 2n - 1.
            l=0

The number agrees, as it should, with the move count obtained earlier.
EXAMPLE 3        As our next example, we investigate a recursive version of the
algorithm discussed at the end of Section 2.3.
ALGORITHM        BinRec(n)
   //Input: A positive decimal integer n
   //Output: The number of binary digits in n's binary representation
   if n = 1 return 1
   else return BinRec( n/2 ) + 1
   Let us set up a recurrence and an initial condition for the number of addi-
tions A(n) made by the algorithm. The number of additions made in computing
BinRec( n/2 ) is A( n/2 ), plus one more addition is made by the algorithm to
increase the returned value by 1. This leads to the recurrence
                           A(n) = A( n/2 ) + 1          for n > 1.                        (2.4)
Since the recursive calls end when n is equal to 1 and there are no additions made
then, the initial condition is
                                        A(1) = 0.
   The presence of    n/2       in the function's argument makes the method of back-
ward substitutions stumble on values of n that are not powers of 2. Therefore, the
standard approach to solving such a recurrence is to solve it only for n = 2k and
then take advantage of the theorem called the smoothness rule (see Appendix B),
which claims that under very broad assumptions the order of growth observed for
n = 2k gives a correct answer about the order of growth for all values of n. (Alter-
natively, after getting a solution for powers of 2, we can sometimes fine-tune this
solution to get a formula valid for an arbitrary n.) So let us apply this recipe to our
recurrence, which for n = 2k takes the form
                          A(2k) = A(2k-1) + 1             for k > 0,
                          A(20) = 0.
    Now backward substitutions encounter no problems:
        A(2k) = A(2k-1) + 1                       substitute A(2k-1) = A(2k-2) + 1
            = [A(2k-2) + 1] + 1 = A(2k-2) + 2     substitute A(2k-2) = A(2k-3) + 1
            = [A(2k-3) + 1] + 2 = A(2k-3) + 3                         ...
                          ...
                                 = A(2k-i) + i
                          ...
                                 = A(2k-k) + k.
    Thus, we end up with
                                  A(2k) = A(1) + k = k,
    or, after returning to the original variable n = 2k and hence k = log2 n,
                                  A(n) = log2 n       (log n).
    In fact, one can prove (Problem 7 in this section's exercises) that the exact solution
    for an arbitrary value of n is given by just a slightly more refined formula A(n) =
    log2 n .
        This section provides an introduction to the analysis of recursive algorithms.
    These techniques will be used throughout the book and expanded further as
    necessary. In the next section, we discuss the Fibonacci numbers; their analysis
    involves more difficult recurrence relations to be solved by a method different
    from backward substitutions.

     column j , and Aj is the (n - 1) × (n - 1) matrix obtained from matrix A by
     deleting its row 0 and column j .
     a.  Set up a recurrence relation for the number of multiplications made by the
         algorithm implementing this recursive definition.
     b. Without solving the recurrence, what can you say about the solution's order
         of growth as compared to n!?
12.  von Neumann's neighborhood revisited                   Find the number of cells in the von
     Neumann neighborhood of range n (Problem 12 in Exercises 2.3) by setting
     up and solving a recurrence relation.
13.  Frying hamburgers    There are n hamburgers to be fried on a small grill that
     can hold only two hamburgers at a time. Each hamburger has to be fried
     on both sides; frying one side of a hamburger takes 1 minute, regardless of
     whether one or two hamburgers are fried at the same time. Consider the
     following recursive algorithm for executing this task in the minimum amount
     of time. If n  2, fry the hamburger or the two hamburgers together on each
     side. If n > 2, fry any two hamburgers together on each side and then apply
     the same procedure recursively to the remaining n - 2 hamburgers.
     a.  Set up and solve the recurrence for the amount of time this algorithm needs
         to fry n hamburgers.
     b. Explain why this algorithm does not fry the hamburgers in the minimum
         amount of time for all n > 0.
     c.  Give a correct recursive algorithm that executes the task in the minimum
         amount of time.
14.  Celebrity problem    A celebrity among a group of n people is a person who
     knows nobody but is known by everybody else. The task is to identify a
     celebrity by only asking questions to people of the form "Do you know
     him/her?" Design an efficient algorithm to identify a celebrity or determine
     that the group has no such person. How many questions does your algorithm
     need in the worst case?
