Sorting by Counting
As a first example of applying the input-enhancement technique, we discuss its
          application to the sorting problem. One rather obvious idea is to count, for each
          element of a list to be sorted, the total number of elements smaller than this
          element and record the results in a table. These numbers will indicate the positions
          of the elements in the sorted list: e.g., if the count is 10 for some element, it should
          be in the 11th position (with index 10, if we start counting with 0) in the sorted
          array. Thus, we will be able to sort the list by simply copying its elements to their
          appropriate positions in a new, sorted list. This algorithm is called comparison-
          counting sort (Figure 7.1).

ALGORITHM    ComparisonCountingSort(A[0..n - 1])
//Sorts an array by comparison counting
//Input: An array A[0..n - 1] of orderable elements
//Output: Array S[0..n - 1] of A's elements sorted in                            nondecreasing        order
for i  0 to n - 1 do Count[i]  0
for i  0 to n - 2 do
        for j  i + 1 to n - 1 do
             if A[i] < A[j ]
             Count[j ]  Count[j ] + 1
             else Count[i]  Count[i] + 1
for i  0 to n - 1 do S[Count[i]]  A[i]
return S
What is the time efficiency of this algorithm? It should be quadratic because
the algorithm considers all the different pairs of an n-element array. More formally,
the number of times its basic operation, the comparison A[i] < A[j ], is executed
is equal to the sum we have encountered several times already:
        n-2  n-1              n-2                                       n-2                      n(n  -  1)
C(n) =                  1  =       [(n  -  1)  -  (i  +   1)  +  1]  =       (n  -  1  -  i)  =       2      .
        i=0 j =i+1            i=0                                       i=0
Thus, the algorithm makes the same number of key comparisons as selection sort
and in addition uses a linear amount of extra space. On the positive side, the
algorithm makes the minimum number of key moves possible, placing each of
them directly in their final position in a sorted array.
The counting idea does work productively in a situation in which elements
to be sorted belong to a known small set of values. Assume, for example, that
we have to sort a list whose values can be either 1 or 2. Rather than applying a
general sorting algorithm, we should be able to take advantage of this additional
     information about values to be sorted. Indeed, we can scan the list to compute
     the number of 1's and the number of 2's in it and then, on the second pass,
     simply make the appropriate number of the first elements equal to 1 and the
     remaining elements equal to 2. More generally, if element values are integers
     between some lower bound l and upper bound u, we can compute the frequency
     of each of those values and store them in array F [0..u - l]. Then the first F [0]
     positions in the sorted list must be filled with l, the next F [1] positions with l + 1,
     and so on. All this can be done, of course, only if we can overwrite the given
     elements.
     Let us consider a more realistic situation of sorting a list of items with some
     other information associated with their keys so that we cannot overwrite the list's
     elements. Then we can copy elements into a new array S[0..n - 1]to hold the sorted
     list as follows. The elements of A whose values are equal to the lowest possible
     value l are copied into the first F [0] elements of S, i.e., positions 0 through F [0] - 1;
     the elements of value l + 1 are copied to positions from F [0] to (F [0] + F [1]) - 1;
     and so on.   Since such accumulated sums of frequencies are called a distribution
     in statistics, the method itself is known as distribution counting.
     EXAMPLE      Consider sorting the array
                                13  11  12    13      12  12
     whose values are known to come from the set {11, 12, 13} and should not be
     overwritten in the process of sorting. The frequency and distribution arrays are
     as follows:
                  Array values                    11      12  13
                  Frequencies                     1       3   2
                  Distribution values             1       4   6
     Note that the distribution values indicate the proper positions for the last occur-
     rences of their elements in the final sorted array. If we index array positions from 0
     to n - 1, the distribution values must be reduced by 1 to get corresponding element
     positions.
     It is more convenient to process the input array right to left. For the example,
     the last element is 12, and, since its distribution value is 4, we place this 12 in
     position 4 - 1 = 3 of the array S that will hold the sorted list. Then we decrease
     the 12's distribution value by 1 and proceed to the next (from the right) element
     in the given array. The entire processing of this example is depicted in Figure 7.2.

              A [5] = 12  1          4      6                       12
              A [4] = 12  1          3      6                   12
              A [3] = 13  1          2      6                                 13
              A [2] = 12  1          2      5               12
              A [1] = 11  1          1      5      11
              A [0] = 13  0          1      5                             13

              decremented are shown in bold.
    Here is pseudocode of this algorithm.
ALGORITHM     DistributionCountingSort(A[0..n - 1], l, u)
    //Sorts an array of integers from a limited range by distribution counting
    //Input: An array A[0..n - 1] of integers between l and u (l  u)
    //Output: Array S[0..n - 1] of A's elements sorted in nondecreasing order
    for j  0 to u - l do D[j ]  0                                   //initialize frequencies
    for i  0 to n - 1 do D[A[i] - l]  D[A[i] - l] + 1 //compute frequencies
    for j  1 to u - l do D[j ]  D[j - 1] + D[j ]                    //reuse for distribution
    for i  n - 1 downto 0 do
        j  A[i] - l
        S[D[j ] - 1]  A[i]
        D[j ]  D[j ] - 1
    return S
    Assuming that the range of array values is fixed, this is obviously a linear
algorithm because it makes just two consecutive passes through its input array
A. This is a better time-efficiency class than that of the most efficient sorting
algorithms--mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort--we have encountered. It is im-
portant to remember, however, that this efficiency is obtained by exploiting the
specific nature of inputs for which sorting by distribution counting works, in addi-
tion to trading space for time.

          6.   The ancestry problem asks to determine whether a vertex u is an ancestor
               of vertex v in a given binary (or, more generally, rooted ordered) tree of n
               vertices. Design a O(n) input-enhancement algorithm that provides sufficient
               information to solve this problem for any pair of the tree's vertices in constant
               time.
          7.   The following technique, known as virtual initialization, provides a time-
               efficient way to initialize just some elements of a given array A[0..n - 1] so
               that for each of its elements, we can say in constant time whether it has been
               initialized and, if it has been, with which value. This is done by utilizing a
               variable counter for the number of initialized elements in A and two auxiliary
               arrays of the same size, say B[0..n - 1] and C[0..n - 1], defined as follows.
               B[0], . . . , B[counter - 1] contain the indices of the elements of A that were
               initialized: B[0] contains the index of the element initialized first, B[1] contains
               the index of the element initialized second, etc. Furthermore, if A[i] was the
               kth element (0  k  counter - 1) to be initialized, C[i] contains k.

               b. In general, how can we check with this scheme whether A[i] has been
                   initialized and, if it has been, with which value?
