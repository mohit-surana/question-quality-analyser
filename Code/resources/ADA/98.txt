Selection Sort and Bubble Sort
In this section, we consider the application of the brute-force approach to the
         problem of sorting: given a list of n orderable items (e.g., numbers, characters
         from some alphabet, character strings), rearrange them in nondecreasing order.
         As we mentioned in Section 1.3, dozens of algorithms have been developed for
         solving this very important problem. You might have learned several of them in
         the past. If you have, try to forget them for the time being and look at the problem
         afresh.
         Now, after your mind is unburdened of previous knowledge of sorting algo-
         rithms, ask yourself a question: "What would be the most straightforward method
         for solving the sorting problem?" Reasonable people may disagree on the answer
         to this question. The two algorithms discussed here--selection sort and bubble
         sort--seem to be the two prime candidates.
         Selection Sort
         We start selection sort by scanning the entire given list to find its smallest element
         and exchange it with the first element, putting the smallest element in its final
         position in the sorted list. Then we scan the list, starting with the second element,
         to find the smallest among the last n - 1 elements and exchange it with the second
         element, putting the second smallest element in its final position. Generally, on the
ith pass through the list, which we number from 0 to n - 2, the algorithm searches
for the smallest item among the last n - i elements and swaps it with Ai:
                    A0  A1  . . .  Ai­1  Ai, . . . , Amin, . . . , An­1
                    in their final positions             the last n ­ i elements
After n - 1 passes, the list is sorted.
Here is pseudocode of this algorithm, which, for simplicity, assumes that the
list is implemented as an array:
ALGORITHM       SelectionSort(A[0..n - 1])
//Sorts a given array by selection sort
//Input: An array A[0..n - 1] of orderable elements
//Output: Array A[0..n - 1] sorted in nondecreasing order
for i  0 to n - 2 do
        min  i
        for j  i + 1 to n - 1 do
             if A[j ] < A[min]        min  j
        swap A[i] and A[min]
As an example, the action of the algorithm on the list 89, 45, 68, 90, 29, 34, 17
is illustrated in Figure 3.1.
The analysis of selection sort is straightforward. The input size is given by the
number of elements n; the basic operation is the key comparison A[j ] < A[min].
The number of times it is executed depends only on the array size and is given by
the following sum:
                n-2  n-1              n-2                                     n-2
        C(n) =                 1=          [(n - 1) - (i + 1) + 1] =               (n - 1 - i).
                i=0 j =i+1            i=0                                     i=0
                      | 89            45      68     90     29     34     17
                               17  |  45      68     90     29     34     89
                               17     29   |  68     90     45     34     89
                               17     29      34  |  90     45     68     89
                               17     29      34     45  |  90     68     89
                               17     29      34     45     68  |  90     89
                               17     29      34     45     68     89  |  90
FIGURE  3.1  Example of sorting with selection sort. Each line corresponds to one
             iteration of the algorithm, i.e., a pass through the list's tail to the right
             of the vertical bar; an element in bold indicates the smallest element
             found. Elements to the left of the vertical bar are in their final positions and
             are not considered in this and subsequent iterations.
     Since we have already encountered the last sum in analyzing the algorithm of
     Example 2 in Section 2.3, you should be able to compute it now on your own.
     Whether you compute this sum by distributing the summation symbol or by
     immediately getting the sum of decreasing integers, the answer, of course, must
     be the same:
                                n-2  n-1            n-2                      (n  -  1)n .
                   C(n) =                     1  =       (n  -  1  -  i)  =      2
                                  i=0 j =i+1        i=0
     Thus, selection sort is a     (n2) algorithm on all inputs. Note, however, that the
     number of key swaps is only     (n), or, more precisely, n - 1 (one for each repetition
     of the i loop). This property distinguishes selection sort positively from many other
     sorting algorithms.
     Bubble Sort
     Another brute-force application to the sorting problem is to compare adjacent
     elements of the list and exchange them if they are out of order. By doing it
     repeatedly, we end up "bubbling up" the largest element to the last position on
     the list. The next pass bubbles up the second largest element, and so on, until
     after n - 1 passes the list is sorted. Pass i (0  i  n - 2) of bubble sort can be
     represented by the following diagram:
                   A0, . . . , Aj ? Aj+1, . . . , An-i-1 | An-i  . . .  An-1
                                                                   in their final positions
     Here is pseudocode of this algorithm.
     ALGORITHM     BubbleSort(A[0..n - 1])
     //Sorts a given array by bubble sort
     //Input: An array A[0..n - 1] of orderable elements
     //Output: Array A[0..n - 1] sorted in nondecreasing order
     for i  0 to n - 2 do
     for j  0 to n - 2 - i do
                   if A[j + 1] < A[j ] swap A[j ] and A[j + 1]
     The action of the algorithm on the list 89, 45, 68, 90, 29, 34, 17 is illustrated
     as an example in Figure 3.2.
     The number of key comparisons for the bubble-sort version given above is
     the same for all arrays of size n; it is obtained by a sum that is almost identical to
     the sum for selection sort:
             89  ?           45           68          90           29          34        17
             45              89  ?        68          90           29          34        17
             45              68           89      ?   90    ?      29          34        17
             45              68           89          29           90      ?   34        17
             45              68           89          29           34          90     ?  17
             45              68           89          29           34          17     |  90
             45  ?           68  ?        89      ?   29              34       17     |  90
             45              68           29          89    ?         34       17     |  90
             45              68           29          34              89   ?   17     |  90
             45              68           29          34              17    |  89        90
                                                     etc.
FIGURE  3.2  First two passes of bubble sort on the list 89, 45, 68, 90, 29, 34, 17. A new
             line is shown after a swap of two elements is done. The elements to the
             right of the vertical bar are in their final positions and are not considered in
             subsequent iterations of the algorithm.

                 C(n) =                           1=        [(n - 2 - i) - 0 + 1]
                                 i=0     j =0         i=0
                                 n-2                        (n  -     1)n
                             =        (n  -    1  -  i)  =         2           (n2).
                                 i=0
The number of key swaps, however, depends on the input. In the                               worst  case  of
decreasing arrays, it is the same as the number of key comparisons:
                             Sworst (n)   =   C(n)    =   (n  - 1)n            (n2).
                                                                2
As is often the case with an application of the brute-force strategy, the first
version of an algorithm obtained can often be improved upon with a modest
amount of effort. Specifically, we can improve the crude version of bubble sort
given above by exploiting the following observation: if a pass through the list
makes no exchanges, the list has been sorted and we can stop the algorithm
(Problem 12a in this section's exercises). Though the new version runs faster on
some inputs, it is still in      (n2) in the worst and average cases. In fact, even among
elementary sorting methods, bubble sort is an inferior choice, and if it were not for
its catchy name, you would probably have never heard of it. However, the general
lesson you just learned is important and worth repeating:
A first application of the brute-force approach often results in an algorithm
that can be improved with a modest amount of effort.
