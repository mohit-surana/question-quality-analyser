since the vast majority of algorithms of interest operate on data particular ways of organizing data play a critical role in the design and analysis of algorithms. a data structure can be defined as a particular scheme of organizing related data items. the nature of the data items is dictated by the problem at hand they can range from elementary data types e.g. integers or characters to data structures e.g. a one dimensional array of one dimensional arrays is often used for implementing matrices . there are a few data structures that have proved to be particularly important for computer algorithms. since you are undoubtedly familiar with most if not all of them just a quick review is provided here.
