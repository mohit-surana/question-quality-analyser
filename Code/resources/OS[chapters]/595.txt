        In brief, the conventional arguments that bird brains are too small
        or do not have particular structures needed for intelligence are based
        on ignorance of brains in general and bird brains in particular. It is
        unwarranted to argue that the small brains and small bodies of birds
        render them less capable of behaving with intelligent awareness than
        animals with large brains and large bodies.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
     ·  Explain the concept of embedded system.
     ·  Understand the characteristics of embedded operating systems.
     ·  Describe the architecture and key features of eCos.
     ·  Describe the architecture and key features of TinyOS.
     In this chapter, we examine one of the most important and widely used catego-
     ries of operating systems: embedded operating systems. The embedded system
     environment places unique and demanding requirements on the OS and calls for
     design strategies quite different than that found in ordinary operating systems.
        We begin with an overview of the concept of embedded systems and then
     turn to an examination of the principles of embedded operating systems. Finally,
     this chapter surveys two very different approaches to embedded OS design.
13.1 EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
     The term embedded system refers to the use of electronics and software within a
     product, as opposed to a general-purpose computer, such as a laptop or desktop
     system. The following is a good general definition:1
     Embedded system: A combination of computer hardware and software, and
     perhaps additional mechanical or other parts, designed to perform a dedicated
     function. In many cases, embedded systems are part of a larger system or prod-
     uct, as in the case of an antilock braking system in a car.
        Embedded systems far outnumber general-purpose computer systems, encom-
     passing a broad range of applications (Table 13.1). These systems have widely varying
     requirements and constraints, such as the following [GRIM05]:
        · Small to large systems, implying very different cost constraints, thus different
        needs for optimization and reuse

·  Relaxed to very strict requirements and combinations of different quality
   requirements, for example, with respect to safety, reliability, real-time,
   flexibility, and legislation
·  Short to long lifetimes
·  Different environmental conditions in terms of, for example, radiation, vibra-
   tions, and humidity
·  Different application characteristics resulting in static versus dynamic loads,
   slow to fast speed, compute versus interface intensive tasks, and/or combinations
   thereof
·  Different models of computation ranging from discrete-event systems to those
   involving continuous time dynamics (usually referred to as hybrid systems)
   Often, embedded systems are tightly coupled to their environment. This can
give rise to real-time constraints imposed by the need to interact with the environ-
ment. Constraints, such as required speeds of motion, required precision of meas-
urement, and required time durations, dictate the timing of software operations. If
multiple activities must be managed simultaneously, this imposes more complex
real-time constraints.

                     Figure 13.1  Possible Organization of  an  Embedded System
         Figure 13.1, based on [KOOP96], shows in general terms an embedded system
      organization. In addition to the processor and memory, there are a number of
      elements that differ from the typical desktop or laptop computer:
      ·  There may be a variety of interfaces that enable the system to measure,
         manipulate, and otherwise interact with the external environment.
      ·  The human interface may be as simple as a flashing light or as complicated as
         real-time robotic vision.
      ·  The diagnostic port may be used for diagnosing the system that is being
         controlled--not just for diagnosing the embedded computer.
      ·  Special-purpose field programmable (FPGA), application specific (ASIC), or
         even nondigital hardware may be used to increase performance or safety.
      ·  Software often has a fixed function and is specific to the application.
